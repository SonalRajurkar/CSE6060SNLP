## Natural Language Processing Tasks

In this project, I have implemented various NLP tasks which includes exploring NLTK, SpaCy, regional language(in marathi). This also includes chunking, embedding and various tasks performed in marathi language. 

## Exploring NLTK 
In this I have performed tokenization, POS tagging operations, Stemming, Lemmatizer, Wordnet, Vectorization, Chunking, Embedding, Text Classification, Classification using Logistic Regression and basic pipeline operations. 

## Exploring Spacy
In this I have explored basic functionalities of SpaCy. How it defers from nltk and its experiments.
