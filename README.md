## Natural Language Processing Tasks

In this project, I have implemented various NLP tasks which includes exploring NLTK, SpaCy, regional language(in marathi). This also includes chunking, embedding and various tasks performed in marathi language. 

## Exploring NLTK 
In this I have performed tokenization, POS tagging operations, Stemming, Lemmatizer, Wordnet, Vectorization, Chunking, Embedding, Text Classification, Classification using Logistic Regression and basic pipeline operations.

## Exploring Spacy
In this I have explored basic functionalities of SpaCy. How it defers from nltk and its experiments.

## Exploring regional language
In this nlp tasks were performed in marathi language. I performed tokenization, similarity, prediction of next words, vectorization in that.

## Sentiment analysis movie review
This python file contains the sentiment analysis performed on movie data. I am presently working on sentiment analysis in Marathi using Marathi WordNet.

## Review doc
This doc file contains review of 5 research papers on sentiment analysis. I have referred 5 papers and written the summary of those including all statistics and tables. This was done in place of quiz (not attended quiz 1)

## FSA 
This word file contains the finite state automata of adjectives in marathi language with examples.
