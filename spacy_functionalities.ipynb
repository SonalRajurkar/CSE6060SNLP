      "\r\n",
      "A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to\r\n",
      "understand his work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working\r\n",
      "and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\r\n",
      "children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\r\n",
      "in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\r\n",
      "character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\r\n",
      "final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\r\n",
      "already begun his first work, âPoor Folk.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\r\n",
      "was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\r\n",
      "instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\r\n",
      "seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\r\n",
      "was arrested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\r\n",
      "was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\r\n",
      "and Proudhon. He was accused of âtaking part in conversations against\r\n",
      "the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\r\n",
      "knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.â Under Nicholas\r\n",
      "I. (that âstern and just man,â as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\r\n",
      "enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight monthsâ imprisonment\r\n",
      "he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\r\n",
      "be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: âThey snapped\r\n",
      "words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\r\n",
      "persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\r\n",
      "to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\r\n",
      "a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\r\n",
      "I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\r\n",
      "bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\r\n",
      "brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\r\n",
      "us our lives.â The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\r\n",
      "never regained his sanity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\r\n",
      "Dostoevskyâs mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\r\n",
      "accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\r\n",
      "in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\r\n",
      "He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\r\n",
      "cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\r\n",
      "servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\r\n",
      "he began the âDead House,â and some years of service in a disciplinary\r\n",
      "battalion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\r\n",
      "and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\r\n",
      "suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\r\n",
      "a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\r\n",
      "allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--âVremya,â which was\r\n",
      "forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\r\n",
      "his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\r\n",
      "he took upon himself the payment of his brotherâs debts. He started\r\n",
      "another journal--âThe Epoch,â which within a few months was also\r\n",
      "prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brotherâs family was\r\n",
      "dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\r\n",
      "said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\r\n",
      "much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\r\n",
      "monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\r\n",
      "demonstrations of love and honour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\r\n",
      "vast multitude of mourners, who âgave the hapless man the funeral of a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\r\n",

      "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\r\n",
      "the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\r\n",
      "in hesitation, towards K. bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\r\n",
      "garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\r\n",
      "like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\r\n",
      "dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\r\n",
      "he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\r\n",
      "invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\r\n",
      "sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\r\n",
      "hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\r\n",
      "for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\r\n",
      "verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\r\n",
      "himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\r\n",
      "only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\r\n",
      "anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\r\n",
      "given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\r\n",
      "desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\r\n",
      "for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\r\n",
      "trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\r\n",
      "and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\r\n",
      "lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\r\n",
      "slip out unseen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\r\n",
      "aware of his fears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\r\n",
      "trifles,â he thought, with an odd smile. âHm... yes, all is in a manâs\r\n",
      "hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, thatâs an axiom. It would\r\n",
      "be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\r\n",
      "step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\r\n",
      "too much. Itâs because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\r\n",
      "that I chatter because I do nothing. Iâve learned to chatter this\r\n",
      "last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\r\n",
      "Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\r\n",
      "_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. Itâs simply a fantasy to amuse\r\n",
      "myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\r\n",
      "and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\r\n",
      "special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\r\n",
      "of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young manâs already\r\n",
      "overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\r\n",
      "are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\r\n",
      "whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\r\n",
      "the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\r\n",
      "disgust gleamed for a moment in the young manâs refined face. He was,\r\n",
      "by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\r\n",
      "well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\r\n",
      "into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\r\n",
      "of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\r\n",
      "to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\r\n",
      "habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\r\n",
      "moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\r\n",
      "tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\r\n",
      "food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\r\n",
      "have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\r\n",
      "of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\r\n",
      "created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\r\n",
      "of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\r\n",
      "and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\r\n",
      "heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\r\n",
      "that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\r\n",
      "such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young manâs heart, that,\r\n",
      "in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\r\n",
      "of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\r\n",
      "acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\r\n",
      "meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\r\n",
      "reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\r\n",
      "dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: âHey there, German\r\n",
      "hatterâ bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\r\n",
      "man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\r\n",
      "round hat from Zimmermanâs, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\r\n",
      "torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\r\n",
      "fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\r\n",
      "had overtaken him.\r\n",

      "spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\r\n",

      "them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\r\n",
      "his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\r\n",
      "this âhideousâ dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\r\n",
      "still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\r\n",
      "ârehearsalâ of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\r\n",
      "and more violent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\r\n",
      "There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\r\n",
      "two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\r\n",
      "the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\r\n",
      "at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\r\n",
      "staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\r\n",
      "with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\r\n",
      "in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\r\n",

      "âIf I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\r\n",
      "I were really going to do it?â he could not help asking himself as he\r\n",
      "reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\r\n",
      "who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\r\n",
      "flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\r\n",
      "family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\r\n",
      "staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. âThatâs a good\r\n",
      "thing anyway,â he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\r\n",
      "womanâs flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\r\n",
      "tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\r\n",
      "that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\r\n",
      "its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\r\n",
      "clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\r\n",
      "by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\r\n",
      "woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\r\n",
      "nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\r\n",
      "But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\r\n",
      "opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\r\n",
      "was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\r\n",
      "him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\r\n",
      "withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\r\n",
      "little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\r\n",
      "with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\r\n",
      "which looked like a henâs leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\r\n",
      "and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\r\n",
      "fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\r\n",
      "instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âRaskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,â the young man made\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,â the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âAnd here... I am again on the same errand,â Raskolnikov continued, a\r\n",
      "little disconcerted and surprised at the old womanâs mistrust. âPerhaps\r\n",
      "she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\r\n",
      "time,â he thought with an uneasy feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\r\n",
      "and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\r\n",
      "in front of her:\r\n",

      "lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo the sun will shine like this _then_ too!â flashed as it were by\r\n",
      "chance through Raskolnikovâs mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\r\n",
      "everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\r\n",
      "remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\r\n",
      "furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\r\n",
      "a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\r\n",
      "dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\r\n",
      "chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\r\n",
      "frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\r\n",
      "all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\r\n",
      "was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\r\n",
      "everything shone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLizavetaâs work,â thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âItâs in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\r\n",
      "cleanliness,â Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\r\n",
      "at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\r\n",
      "which stood the old womanâs bed and chest of drawers and into which he\r\n",
      "had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat do you want?â the old woman said severely, coming into the room\r\n",
      "and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\r\n",
      "the face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIâve brought something to pawn here,â and he drew out of his pocket\r\n",
      "an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\r\n",
      "globe; the chain was of steel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\r\n",

      "I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âGive me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my fatherâs. I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âPlease yourselfâ--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\r\n",
      "young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\r\n",
      "away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\r\n",
      "else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHand it over,â he said roughly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\r\n",
      "the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\r\n",
      "the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\r\n",
      "her unlocking the chest of drawers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt must be the top drawer,â he reflected. âSo she carries the keys in\r\n",
      "a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And thereâs\r\n",
      "one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\r\n",
      "that canât be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\r\n",
      "other chest or strong-box... thatâs worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\r\n",
      "have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman came back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHere, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\r\n",
      "fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\r\n",
      "for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\r\n",
      "on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\r\n",
      "altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\r\n",
      "watch. Here it is.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJust so.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\r\n",
      "old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\r\n",
      "something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\r\n",
      "what.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âGood-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\r\n",
      "and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\r\n",
      "or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\r\n",
      "in the street he cried out, âOh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\r\n",
      "can I, can I possibly.... No, itâs nonsense, itâs rubbish!â he added\r\n",
      "resolutely. âAnd how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\r\n",
      "What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\r\n",
      "disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month Iâve been....â\r\n",
      " But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\r\n",
      "of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\r\n",
      "while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\r\n",
      "pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\r\n",
      "do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\r\n",
      "pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\r\n",
      "against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\r\n",
      "street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\r\n",
      "which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\r\n",
      "At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\r\n",
      "supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\r\n",
      "think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\r\n",
      "never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\r\n",
      "burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\r\n",
      "sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\r\n",
      "table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\r\n",
      "off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\r\n",
      "clear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAll thatâs nonsense,â he said hopefully, âand there is nothing in it\r\n",
      "all to worry about! Itâs simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\r\n",
      "beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\r\n",
      "the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\r\n",
      "is!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\r\n",
      "as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\r\n",
      "round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\r\n",
      "moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\r\n",
      "not normal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\r\n",
      "men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\r\n",
      "a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\r\n",
      "left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\r\n",
      "were a man who appeared to be an artisan, drunk, but not extremely so,\r\n",
      "sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\r\n",
      "a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\r\n",
      "dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\r\n",
      "his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\r\n",
      "part of his body bounding about on the bench, while he hummed some\r\n",
      "meaningless refrain, trying to recall some such lines as these:\r\n",

      "But no one shared his enjoyment: his silent companion looked with\r\n",
      "positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\r\n",
      "another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\r\n",
      "clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\r\n",
      "society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\r\n",
      "felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\r\n",
      "place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\r\n",
      "was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\r\n",
      "excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\r\n",
      "world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\r\n",
      "surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\r\n",
      "came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\r\n",
      "red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\r\n",
      "person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\r\n",
      "with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\r\n",
      "iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\r\n",
      "another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\r\n",
      "counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\r\n",
      "some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\r\n",
      "close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\r\n",
      "an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\r\n",
      "first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\r\n",
      "like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\r\n",
      "afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\r\n",
      "at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\r\n",
      "persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\r\n",
      "the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\r\n",
      "looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\r\n",
      "a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\r\n",
      "culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\r\n",
      "converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\r\n",
      "and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\r\n",
      "a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\r\n",
      "reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\r\n",
      "strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\r\n",
      "feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\r\n",
      "same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\r\n",
      "old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\r\n",
      "except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\r\n",
      "last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\r\n",
      "and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\r\n",
      "no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\r\n",
      "looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\r\n",
      "and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\r\n",
      "ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\r\n",
      "hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\r\n",
      "table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\r\n",
      "resolutely:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMay I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\r\n",
      "Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\r\n",

      "accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\r\n",

      "addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\r\n",
      "company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\r\n",
      "habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\r\n",
      "or attempted to approach him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA student then, or formerly a student,â cried the clerk. âJust what\r\n",
      "I thought! Iâm a man of experience, immense experience, sir,â and he\r\n",
      "tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. âYouâve been a\r\n",
      "student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....â\r\n",
      " He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\r\n",
      "the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\r\n",
      "fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\r\n",
      "sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\r\n",
      "greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHonoured sir,â he began almost with solemnity, âpoverty is not a vice,\r\n",
      "thatâs a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\r\n",
      "and that thatâs even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\r\n",
      "vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\r\n",
      "in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\r\n",
      "society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\r\n",
      "humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\r\n",
      "I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\r\n",
      "Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\r\n",
      "my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\r\n",
      "to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\r\n",
      "a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, I have not happened to,â answered Raskolnikov. âWhat do you mean?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, Iâve just come from one and itâs the fifth night Iâve slept\r\n",
      "so....â He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\r\n",
      "fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\r\n",
      "probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\r\n",
      "His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\r\n",
      "nails.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\r\n",
      "boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\r\n",
      "upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the âfunny fellowâ\r\n",
      " and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\r\n",
      "Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\r\n",
      "likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\r\n",
      "frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\r\n",
      "the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\r\n",
      "especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\r\n",
      "at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\r\n",
      "themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFunny fellow!â pronounced the innkeeper. âAnd why donât you work, why\r\n",
      "arenât you at your duty, if you are in the service?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy am I not at my duty, honoured sir,â Marmeladov went on, addressing\r\n",
      "himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\r\n",
      "that question to him. âWhy am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\r\n",
      "to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\r\n",
      "beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didnât I suffer?\r\n",
      "Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\r\n",
      "petition hopelessly for a loan?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\r\n",
      "will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\r\n",
      "certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\r\n",
      "on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\r\n",
      "For he knows of course that I shanât pay it back. From compassion? But\r\n",
      "Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\r\n",
      "that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that thatâs\r\n",
      "what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\r\n",
      "ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\r\n",
      "he wonât, I set off to him and...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy do you go?â put in Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\r\n",
      "have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\r\n",
      "go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\r\n",
      "then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),â he added\r\n",
      "in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\r\n",
      "âNo matter, sir, no matter!â he went on hurriedly and with apparent\r\n",
      "composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\r\n",
      "innkeeper smiled--âNo matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\r\n",
      "their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\r\n",
      "that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\r\n",
      "with humility. So be it! So be it! âBehold the man!â Excuse me, young\r\n",
      "man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\r\n",
      "_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man did not answer a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell,â the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\r\n",
      "after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. âWell, so be\r\n",
      "it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officerâs\r\n",
      "daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\r\n",
      "noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\r\n",
      "if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\r\n",
      "ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\r\n",
      "I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\r\n",
      "I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,â he\r\n",
      "declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--âbut, my\r\n",
      "God, if she would but once.... But no, no! Itâs all in vain and itâs no\r\n",
      "use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\r\n",
      "and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\r\n",
      "beast by nature!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âRather!â assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\r\n",
      "resolutely on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSuch is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\r\n",
      "stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\r\n",
      "order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\r\n",
      "Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\r\n",
      "property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\r\n",
      "winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\r\n",
      "little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\r\n",
      "night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for sheâs\r\n",
      "been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\r\n",
      "a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I donât feel it?\r\n",
      "And the more I drink the more I feel it. Thatâs why I drink too. I try\r\n",
      "to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\r\n",
      "twice as much!â And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\r\n",
      "table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYoung man,â he went on, raising his head again, âin your face I seem to\r\n",
      "read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\r\n",
      "I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\r\n",
      "do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\r\n",
      "who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\r\n",
      "of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\r\n",
      "high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\r\n",
      "danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\r\n",
      "which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\r\n",
      "The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\r\n",
      "certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\r\n",
      "it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\r\n",
      "with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\r\n",
      "honours and of the happy days that are gone. I donât condemn her for\r\n",
      "it, I donât blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\r\n",
      "the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\r\n",
      "of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\r\n",
      "nothing but black bread to eat, but wonât allow herself to be treated\r\n",
      "with disrespect. Thatâs why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikovâs\r\n",
      "rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\r\n",
      "her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\r\n",
      "a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\r\n",
      "other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\r\n",
      "ran away with him from her fatherâs house. She was exceedingly fond of\r\n",
      "her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\r\n",
      "died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\r\n",
      "which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\r\n",
      "him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\r\n",
      "that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\r\n",
      "once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\r\n",
      "a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\r\n",
      "was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\r\n",
      "and downs of all sort, I donât feel equal to describing it even. Her\r\n",
      "relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\r\n",
      "proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\r\n",
      "widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\r\n",
      "her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\r\n",
      "judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\r\n",
      "and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\r\n",
      "wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\r\n",
      "married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\r\n",
      "understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\r\n",
      "that you donât understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\r\n",
      "my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch thisâ (he\r\n",
      "tapped the jug with his finger), âfor I have feelings. But even so, I\r\n",
      "could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\r\n",
      "fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\r\n",
      "it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\r\n",
      "last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\r\n",
      "capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\r\n",
      "situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\r\n",
      "time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\r\n",
      "out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechselâs;\r\n",
      "and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\r\n",
      "There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\r\n",
      "disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\r\n",
      "my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\r\n",
      "from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I wonât speak of. For,\r\n",
      "though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\r\n",
      "lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But itâs no use going over\r\n",
      "that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\r\n",
      "effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\r\n",
      "history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\r\n",
      "had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\r\n",
      "even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\r\n",
      "Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\r\n",
      "other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\r\n",
      "interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewesâ Physiology--do\r\n",
      "you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and thatâs the\r\n",
      "whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\r\n",
      "sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\r\n",
      "a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\r\n",
      "farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\r\n",
      "talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And whatâs\r\n",
      "more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\r\n",
      "him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\r\n",
      "made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\r\n",
      "pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\r\n",
      "put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\r\n",
      "red, as they always are in that disease: âHere you live with us,â says\r\n",
      "she, âyou eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.â\r\n",
      "And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\r\n",
      "little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\r\n",
      "it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\r\n",
      "creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\r\n",
      "little face). She said: âKaterina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\r\n",
      "like that?â And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\r\n",
      "well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\r\n",
      "through the landlady. âAnd why not?â said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\r\n",
      "âyou are something mighty precious to be so careful of!â But donât blame\r\n",
      "her, donât blame her, honoured sir, donât blame her! She was not herself\r\n",
      "when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\r\n",
      "of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\r\n",
      "else.... For thatâs Katerina Ivanovnaâs character, and when children\r\n",
      "cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six oâclock\r\n",
      "I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\r\n",
      "room and about nine oâclock she came back. She walked straight up to\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\r\n",
      "in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\r\n",
      "simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\r\n",
      "made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\r\n",
      "on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\r\n",
      "body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\n",
      "And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\n",
      "go up to Soniaâs little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\n",
      "kissing Soniaâs feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\n",
      "asleep in each otherâs arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\n",
      "drunk.â\r\n",

      "man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?â And Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so thatâs\r\n",
      "how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\n",
      "comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\r\n",

      "wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\r\n",

      "and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\r\n",
      "quite dark at the top of the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\r\n",
      "the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\r\n",
      "littered up with rags of all sorts, especially childrenâs garments.\r\n",
      "Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\r\n",
      "probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\r\n",
      "and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\r\n",
      "stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\r\n",
      "of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\r\n",
      "appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\r\n",
      "but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\r\n",
      "rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechselâs flat was\r\n",
      "divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\r\n",
      "within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\r\n",
      "of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\r\n",
      "slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\r\n",

      "in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\r\n",
      "were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\r\n",
      "glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\r\n",
      "that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\r\n",
      "candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\r\n",
      "Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\r\n",
      "She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\r\n",
      "was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\r\n",
      "staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\r\n",
      "rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\r\n",
      "close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\r\n",
      "curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\r\n",
      "stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\r\n",
      "beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\r\n",
      "wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\r\n",
      "over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\r\n",
      "Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brotherâs neck. She was\r\n",
      "trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\r\n",
      "could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\r\n",
      "dark eyes, which looked larger still from the thinness of her frightened\r\n",
      "face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\r\n",
      "door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\r\n",
      "facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\r\n",
      "he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\r\n",
      "the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\r\n",
      "further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\r\n",
      "and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\r\n",
      "doorway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh!â she cried out in a frenzy, âhe has come back! The criminal! the\r\n",
      "monster!... And where is the money? Whatâs in your pocket, show me! And\r\n",
      "your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\r\n",
      "money! Speak!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\r\n",
      "held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhere is the money?â she cried--âMercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\r\n",
      "There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!â and in a fury\r\n",
      "she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\r\n",
      "seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\r\n",
      "positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,â he called out, shaken to and\r\n",
      "fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\r\n",
      "The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\r\n",
      "corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\r\n",
      "to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\r\n",
      "shaking like a leaf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHeâs drunk it! heâs drunk it all,â the poor woman screamed in\r\n",

      "wringing her hands she pointed to the children. âOh, accursed life!\r\n",
      "And you, are you not ashamed?â--she pounced all at once upon\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov--âfrom the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\r\n",
      "been drinking with him, too! Go away!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\r\n",
      "was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\r\n",
      "laughing faces with pipes and cigarettes and heads wearing caps thrust\r\n",
      "themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\r\n",
      "dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\r\n",
      "them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\r\n",
      "Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\r\n",
      "to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\r\n",
      "outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\r\n",
      "way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\r\n",
      "for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\r\n",
      "with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had time to put his hand into his pocket, to snatch up the\r\n",
      "coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\r\n",
      "lay them unnoticed on the window. Afterwards on the stairs, he changed\r\n",
      "his mind and would have gone back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat a stupid thing Iâve done,â he thought to himself, âthey have Sonia\r\n",

      "let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\r\n",
      "do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\r\n",
      "made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\r\n",
      "in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\r\n",
      "condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\r\n",
      "was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\r\n",
      "This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\r\n",
      "chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\r\n",
      "then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\r\n",
      "writing that this money came from Douniaâs savings, but that was not\r\n",
      "so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\r\n",
      "suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\r\n",
      "you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov treated\r\n",
      "her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\r\n",
      "table.... But I donât want to go into all those painful details, so as\r\n",
      "not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\r\n",
      "of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs\r\n",
      "wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\r\n",
      "especially when Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, relapsing into his old regimental\r\n",
      "habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\r\n",
      "was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\r\n",
      "conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\r\n",
      "it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\r\n",
      "horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\r\n",
      "his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\r\n",
      "And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\r\n",
      "the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\r\n",
      "to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\r\n",
      "inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\r\n",
      "to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\r\n",
      "through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\r\n",
      "account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\r\n",
      "would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\r\n",
      "have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\n",
      "inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\n",
      "not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\r\n",
      "Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\r\n",
      "has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\r\n",
      "she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\r\n",
      "to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\r\n",
      "constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\r\n",
      "garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\r\n",
      "the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\r\n",
      "scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\r\n",
      "shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\r\n",
      "be packed off at once to me in a plain peasantâs cart, into which they\r\n",
      "flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\r\n",
      "folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\r\n",
      "and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\r\n",
      "open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\r\n",
      "could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\r\n",
      "what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\r\n",
      "you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\r\n",
      "and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\r\n",
      "yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\r\n",
      "with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\r\n",
      "whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\r\n",
      "to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\r\n",
      "of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\r\n",
      "us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\r\n",
      "street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\r\n",
      "insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\r\n",
      "so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\r\n",
      "going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\r\n",
      "her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\r\n",
      "month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\r\n",
      "rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\r\n",
      "particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\r\n",
      "at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\r\n",
      "the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\r\n",
      "Dounia bore it better than I did, and if only you could have seen how\r\n",
      "she endured it all and tried to comfort me and cheer me up! She is\r\n",
      "an angel! But by Godâs mercy, our sufferings were cut short: Mr.\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov returned to his senses and repented and, probably\r\n",
      "feeling sorry for Dounia, he laid before Marfa Petrovna a complete and\r\n",
      "unmistakable proof of Douniaâs innocence, in the form of a letter Dounia\r\n",
      "had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\r\n",
      "personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\r\n",
      "her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\r\n",
      "for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\r\n",
      "him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\r\n",
      "infamous it was of him to torment and make unhappy a defenceless girl,\r\n",
      "unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\r\n",
      "touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\r\n",
      "read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\r\n",
      "cleared Douniaâs reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\r\n",
      "than Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\r\n",
      "with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and âagain\r\n",
      "crushedâ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\r\n",
      "Douniaâs innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\r\n",
      "to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\r\n",
      "her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\r\n",
      "came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\r\n",
      "bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\r\n",
      "forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\r\n",
      "the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\r\n",
      "the most flattering terms Douniaâs innocence and the nobility of\r\n",
      "her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\r\n",
      "everyone the letter in Douniaâs own handwriting to Mr. SvidrigaÃ¯lov and\r\n",
      "even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\r\n",
      "superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\r\n",
      "the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\r\n",
      "having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\r\n",
      "that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\r\n",
      "knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\r\n",
      "letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\r\n",
      "of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\r\n",
      "own houses and in other peopleâs. In my opinion a great deal, a very\r\n",
      "great deal of all this was unnecessary; but thatâs Marfa Petrovnaâs\r\n",
      "character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Douniaâs\r\n",

      "began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\r\n",
      "harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\r\n",
      "but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\r\n",
      "respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\r\n",
      "say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\r\n",
      "that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\r\n",
      "him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\r\n",
      "arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\r\n",
      "with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\r\n",
      "could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\r\n",
      "could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\r\n",
      "was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\r\n",
      "has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\r\n",
      "expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\r\n",
      "properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\r\n",
      "us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\r\n",
      "speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\r\n",
      "to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\r\n",
      "of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\r\n",
      "and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\r\n",
      "well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\r\n",
      "and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\r\n",
      "old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\r\n",
      "thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\r\n",
      "presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\r\n",
      "But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\r\n",
      "And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\r\n",
      "do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\r\n",
      "there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\r\n",
      "warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\r\n",
      "upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\r\n",
      "deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\r\n",
      "which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\r\n",
      "At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\r\n",
      "still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions âof our\r\n",
      "most rising generationâ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\r\n",
      "said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\r\n",
      "listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\r\n",
      "little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\r\n",
      "of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\r\n",
      "your sisterâs character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\r\n",
      "generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\r\n",
      "Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\r\n",
      "Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\r\n",
      "it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\r\n",
      "happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\r\n",
      "must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\r\n",
      "is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\r\n",
      "his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\r\n",
      "him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\r\n",
      "certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\r\n",
      "the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\r\n",
      "relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\r\n",
      "that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\r\n",
      "relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\r\n",
      "for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\r\n",
      "from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\r\n",
      "instance, at his second visit, after he had received Douniaâs consent,\r\n",
      "in the course of conversation, he declared that before making\r\n",
      "Douniaâs acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\r\n",
      "good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\r\n",
      "poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\r\n",
      "wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\r\n",
      "benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\r\n",
      "than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\r\n",
      "remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\r\n",
      "but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\r\n",
      "to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\r\n",
      "me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\r\n",
      "vexed, and answered that âwords are not deeds,â and that, of course, is\r\n",
      "perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\r\n",
      "her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\r\n",
      "walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\r\n",
      "the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\r\n",
      "that she had decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\r\n",
      "Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\r\n",
      "a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\r\n",
      "and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\r\n",
      "case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\r\n",
      "the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\r\n",
      "every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\r\n",
      "you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\r\n",
      "your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\r\n",
      "pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\r\n",
      "providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\r\n",
      "ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\r\n",
      "get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\r\n",
      "a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\r\n",
      "duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\r\n",
      "he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\r\n",
      "you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\r\n",
      "Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\r\n",
      "for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\r\n",
      "your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitchâs business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\r\n",
      "student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\r\n",
      "all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\r\n",
      "realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitchâs evasiveness, very\r\n",
      "natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\r\n",
      "persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\r\n",
      "future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\r\n",
      "not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\r\n",
      "take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\r\n",
      "has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\r\n",
      "of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\r\n",
      "of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\r\n",
      "later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\r\n",
      "himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\r\n",
      "you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\r\n",
      "receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\r\n",
      "own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\r\n",
      "with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\r\n",
      "is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\r\n",
      "you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\r\n",
      "you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\r\n",
      "him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\r\n",
      "opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\r\n",
      "Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\r\n",
      "fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\r\n",
      "them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\r\n",
      "delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\r\n",
      "for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\r\n",
      "simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\r\n",
      "noticed more than once in my life that husbands donât quite get on with\r\n",
      "their mothers-in-law, and I donât want to be the least bit in anyoneâs\r\n",
      "way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\r\n",
      "long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\r\n",
      "Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\r\n",
      "joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\r\n",
      "know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\r\n",
      "very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\r\n",
      "almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\r\n",
      "set off for Petersburg, exactly when I donât know, but very, very soon,\r\n",
      "possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\r\n",
      "know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\r\n",
      "own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\r\n",
      "even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\r\n",
      "too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\r\n",
      "press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\r\n",
      "of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\r\n",
      "anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\r\n",
      "so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\r\n",
      "a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\r\n",
      "herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\r\n",
      "although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\r\n",
      "money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\r\n",

      "on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\r\n",
      "you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\r\n",
      "uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\r\n",
      "been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\r\n",
      "is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\r\n",

      "must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\r\n",
      "canât be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\r\n",
      "we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\r\n",
      "that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\r\n",
      "us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\r\n",
      "know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\r\n",
      "quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\r\n",
      "to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\r\n",
      "two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\r\n",
      "history, but so many events have happened! And now, my precious Rodya,\r\n",

      "strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\r\n",
      "quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\r\n",
      "no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\r\n",
      "on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\r\n",
      "properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\r\n",
      "waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\r\n",

      "walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\r\n",

      "she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\r\n",
      "apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\r\n",
      "that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\r\n",
      "could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\r\n",
      "face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\r\n",
      "fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\r\n",
      "and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\r\n",
      "doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\r\n",
      "showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\r\n",

      "deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\r\n",
      "paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\r\n",
      "too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object\r\n",
      "of his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had\r\n",
      "followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at\r\n",
      "him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\r\n",
      "his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\r\n",
      "intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\r\n",
      "man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\r\n",
      "moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\r\n",

      "towards the gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\r\n",
      "himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\r\n",
      "police constable stood between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "âI am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,â he\r\n",
      "added, addressing the gentleman, âcome along, I have something to show\r\n",
      "you.â\r\n",

      "somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and theyâve put her\r\n",
      "out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\r\n",
      "the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\r\n",
      "not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a manâs hands;\r\n",

      "was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\r\n",
      "her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\r\n",
      "he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\r\n",
      "is in this state... thatâs certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\r\n",
      "him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\r\n",
      "is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\r\n",

      "understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\r\n",
      "examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh, what a pity!â he said, shaking his head--âwhy, she is quite a\r\n",
      "child! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,â\r\n",
      " he began addressing her, âwhere do you live?â The girl opened her weary\r\n",
      "and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\r\n",
      "hand.\r\n",

      "you live?â\r\n",

      "even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\r\n",
      "blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\r\n",
      "garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\r\n",
      "feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\r\n",
      "There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\r\n",
      "hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\r\n",
      "figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\r\n",
      "father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\r\n",
      "became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\r\n",
      "winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\r\n",
      "right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\r\n",
      "church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\r\n",

      "memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\r\n",

      "to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\r\n",
      "walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\r\n",
      "was holding his fatherâs hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\r\n",
      "peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\r\n",
      "some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\r\n",
      "townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\r\n",
      "all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\r\n",
      "stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\r\n",
      "drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\r\n",
      "goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\r\n",
      "long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\r\n",
      "mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\r\n",
      "with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\r\n",
      "such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasantsâ\r\n",

      "of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\r\n",
      "a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\r\n",
      "about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\r\n",
      "he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\r\n",

      "their shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\r\n",
      "noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\r\n",

      "such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\r\n",

      "closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\r\n",
      "wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\r\n",
      "costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\r\n",
      "and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\r\n",
      "liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\r\n",
      "in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\r\n",
      "and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\r\n",
      "the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\r\n",

      "and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\r\n",
      "thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\r\n",
      "a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\r\n",
      "made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\r\n",
      "a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\r\n",
      "doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\r\n",
      "moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\r\n",

      "of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\r\n",
      "decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\r\n",
      "could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\r\n",
      "wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\r\n",
      "nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\r\n",
      "reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\r\n",
      "womenâs things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\r\n",
      "they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizavetaâs business. She\r\n",
      "undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\r\n",
      "and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\r\n",
      "little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\r\n",
      "superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\r\n",
      "And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\r\n",
      "strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\r\n",
      "influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\r\n",
      "called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\r\n",
      "give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\r\n",
      "might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\r\n",
      "he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\r\n",
      "remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\r\n",
      "fatherâs old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\r\n",
      "a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\r\n",
      "he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\r\n",
      "at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\r\n",
      "two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\r\n",
      "home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\r\n",
      "idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\r\n",
      "much absorbed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\r\n",
      "did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\r\n",
      "played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\r\n",
      "the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\r\n",
      "give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\r\n",
      "had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\r\n",
      "it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\r\n",
      "impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\r\n",
      "the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âShe is first-rate,â he said. âYou can always get money from her. She is\r\n",
      "as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\r\n",
      "she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\r\n",
      "had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\r\n",
      "were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\r\n",
      "gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\r\n",
      "percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\r\n",
      "that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\r\n",
      "continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\r\n",
      "though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\r\n",

      "âThereâs a phenomenon for you,â cried the student and he laughed.\r\n",

      "They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\r\n",
      "peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\r\n",
      "with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\r\n",
      "for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\r\n",
      "her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\r\n",
      "being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\r\n",
      "day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\r\n",
      "washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\r\n",
      "all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\r\n",
      "without her sisterâs permission. The old woman had already made her\r\n",
      "will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\r\n",
      "farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\r\n",
      "left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\r\n",
      "said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\r\n",
      "unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\r\n",
      "feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\r\n",
      "goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\r\n",
      "most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\r\n",
      "continually with child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut you say she is hideous?â observed the officer.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\r\n",
      "mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\r\n",
      "on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\r\n",
      "with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\r\n",
      "strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\r\n",
      "in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\r\n",
      "the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\r\n",
      "complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\r\n",
      "from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\r\n",
      "wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\r\n",
      "stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\r\n",
      "gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\r\n",
      "raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\r\n",
      "suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\r\n",
      "sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\r\n",
      "listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\r\n",
      "on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\r\n",
      "monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\r\n",
      "previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\r\n",
      "meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\r\n",
      "were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\r\n",
      "haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\r\n",
      "energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\r\n",
      "kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\r\n",
      "to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\r\n",
      "rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\r\n",
      "under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\r\n",
      "strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\r\n",
      "this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\r\n",
      "stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\r\n",
      "ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\r\n",
      "as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\r\n",
      "when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\r\n",
      "long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\r\n",
      "noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\r\n",
      "for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\r\n",
      "street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\r\n",
      "had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\r\n",
      "he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\r\n",
      "quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\r\n",
      "pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\r\n",
      "not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\r\n",
      "could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\r\n",
      "hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\r\n",
      "fortnight before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\r\n",
      "between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\r\n",
      "the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\r\n",
      "pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\r\n",
      "thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\r\n",
      "in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\r\n",
      "a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\r\n",
      "of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\r\n",
      "Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\r\n",
      "he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\r\n",
      "them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\r\n",
      "tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\r\n",
      "was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\r\n",
      "she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\r\n",
      "was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\r\n",
      "minute that the âthingâ was made of wood. All this had been stored by\r\n",
      "him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\r\n",
      "he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt struck six long ago.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLong ago! My God!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\r\n",
      "his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\r\n",
      "most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\r\n",
      "deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\r\n",
      "pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\r\n",
      "on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\r\n",
      "passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\r\n",
      "him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\r\n",
      "they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\r\n",
      "his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\r\n",
      "a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\r\n",
      "plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\r\n",
      "could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\r\n",
      "any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\r\n",
      "as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\r\n",
      "unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\r\n",
      "that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\r\n",
      "Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\r\n",
      "she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\r\n",
      "door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\r\n",
      "about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\r\n",
      "the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\r\n",
      "was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\r\n",
      "Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\r\n",
      "come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\r\n",
      "till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\r\n",
      "the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\r\n",
      "least grounds for suspicion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\r\n",
      "indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\r\n",
      "trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\r\n",
      "utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\r\n",
      "imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\r\n",
      "up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\r\n",
      "the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\r\n",
      "an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\r\n",
      "âcome, let us go and try it--why dream about it!â--and at once he\r\n",
      "had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\r\n",
      "analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\r\n",
      "could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\r\n",
      "he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\r\n",
      "arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\r\n",
      "forcing and drawing him to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\r\n",
      "question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\r\n",
      "detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\r\n",
      "had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\r\n",
      "opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\r\n",
      "of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\r\n",
      "criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\r\n",
      "childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\r\n",
      "and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\r\n",
      "of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\r\n",
      "developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the\r\n",
      "perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\r\n",
      "of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\r\n",
      "individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\r\n",
      "question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\r\n",
      "crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\r\n",
      "the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\r\n",
      "could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\r\n",
      "remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\r\n",
      "simple reason that his design was ânot a crime....â We will omit all the\r\n",
      "process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\r\n",
      "run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\r\n",
      "material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\r\n",
      "mind. âOne has but to keep all oneâs will-power and reason to deal\r\n",
      "with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\r\n",
      "familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....â But\r\n",
      "this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\r\n",
      "came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\r\n",
      "differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\r\n",
      "left the staircase. When he reached the landladyâs kitchen, the door\r\n",
      "of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\r\n",
      "Nastasyaâs absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\r\n",
      "the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\r\n",
      "he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\r\n",
      "saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\r\n",
      "there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\r\n",
      "him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\r\n",
      "all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\r\n",
      "though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\r\n",
      "the axe! He was overwhelmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat made me think,â he reflected, as he went under the gateway, âwhat\r\n",
      "made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\r\n",
      "Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\r\n",
      "his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\r\n",
      "for appearanceâ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\r\n",
      "revolting. âAnd what a chance I have lost for ever!â he muttered,\r\n",
      "standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porterâs little\r\n",
      "dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porterâs\r\n",
      "room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\r\n",
      "right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\r\n",
      "room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\r\n",
      "the porter. âYes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\r\n",
      "the door is wide open.â He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\r\n",
      "it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\r\n",
      "at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\r\n",
      "hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\r\n",
      "âWhen reason fails, the devil helps!â he thought with a strange grin.\r\n",
      "This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\r\n",

      "suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\r\n",
      "at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\r\n",
      "Suddenly he thought of his hat. âGood heavens! I had the money the day\r\n",

      "from the bottom of his soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\r\n",

      "afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\r\n",
      "by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\r\n",
      "garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\r\n",
      "fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\r\n",
      "the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\r\n",
      "garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\r\n",
      "garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\r\n",
      "great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\r\n",
      "in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\r\n",
      "peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\r\n",
      "are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\r\n",
      "sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\r\n",
      "to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. âWhat nonsense!â\r\n",
      " he thought, âbetter think of nothing at all!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\r\n",
      "meets them on the way,â flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\r\n",
      "like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\r\n",
      "he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\r\n",
      "somewhere struck once. âWhat! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\r\n",
      "must be fast!â\r\n",

      "the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\r\n",
      "the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\r\n",
      "side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\r\n",
      "noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\r\n",
      "quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\r\n",
      "head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\r\n",
      "once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\r\n",
      "and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\r\n",
      "stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\r\n",
      "one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\r\n",
      "at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\r\n",
      "a minute and went on. âOf course it would be better if they had not been\r\n",

      "torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\r\n",
      "the thought floated through his mind âShall I go back?â But he made no\r\n",
      "answer and began listening at the old womanâs door, a dead silence. Then\r\n",
      "he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\r\n",
      "then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\r\n",
      "himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. âAm I very pale?â\r\n",
      " he wondered. âAm I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\r\n",
      "better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\r\n",
      "him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\r\n",
      "he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\r\n",

      "knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\r\n",
      "Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\r\n",
      "suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\r\n",
      "heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\r\n",
      "rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\r\n",
      "close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\r\n",
      "listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\r\n",
      "a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\r\n",
      "the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\r\n",
      "and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\r\n",
      "in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\r\n",
      "had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\r\n",

      "that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\r\n",
      "minute, he thought he would have run away from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy do you look at me as though you did not know me?â he said suddenly,\r\n",

      "evidently restored her confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "âFever,â he answered abruptly. âYou canât help getting pale... if youâve\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\r\n",
      "take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\r\n",
      "coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\r\n",
      "more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\r\n",
      "fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut what has he tied it up like this for?â the old woman cried with\r\n",
      "vexation and moved towards him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\r\n",
      "it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\r\n",
      "effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\r\n",
      "seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\r\n",
      "brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\r\n",
      "with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a ratâs tail and\r\n",
      "fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\r\n",
      "As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\r\n",
      "cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\r\n",
      "floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held âthe\r\n",
      "pledge.â Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\r\n",
      "and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\r\n",
      "body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\r\n",
      "face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\r\n",
      "the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\r\n",
      "pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\r\n",
      "from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\r\n",
      "possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\r\n",
      "hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\r\n",
      "particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\r\n",
      "smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\r\n",
      "as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\r\n",
      "with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\r\n",
      "Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\r\n",
      "a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\r\n",
      "drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\r\n",
      "chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\r\n",
      "over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\r\n",
      "away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\r\n",
      "He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\r\n",
      "occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\r\n",
      "still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\r\n",
      "he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\r\n",
      "over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\r\n",
      "she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\r\n",
      "clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\r\n",
      "was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\r\n",
      "it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\r\n",
      "blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\r\n",
      "the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\r\n",
      "with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\r\n",
      "something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\r\n",
      "the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\r\n",
      "dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\r\n",
      "after two minutesâ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\r\n",
      "without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\r\n",
      "purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\r\n",
      "copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\r\n",
      "chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\r\n",
      "very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\r\n",
      "flung the crosses on the old womanâs body and rushed back into the\r\n",
      "bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\r\n",
      "again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\r\n",
      "was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\r\n",
      "mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\r\n",
      "and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\r\n",
      "and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\r\n",
      "there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\r\n",
      "drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\r\n",
      "and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\r\n",
      "of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\r\n",
      "women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\r\n",
      "good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\r\n",
      "lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\r\n",
      "key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\r\n",
      "a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\r\n",
      "then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\r\n",
      "clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\r\n",
      "the red brocade. âItâs red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,â\r\n",
      " the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\r\n",
      "âGood God, am I going out of my senses?â he thought with terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\r\n",
      "under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\r\n",
      "out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\r\n",
      "all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\r\n",
      "ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\r\n",
      "wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\r\n",
      "tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\r\n",
      "and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\r\n",
      "had not time to take many....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\r\n",
      "short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\r\n",
      "his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\r\n",
      "someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\r\n",
      "a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\r\n",
      "holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\r\n",
      "the bedroom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\r\n",
      "She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\r\n",
      "and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\r\n",
      "of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\r\n",
      "shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\r\n",
      "still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\r\n",
      "corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\r\n",
      "sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\r\n",
      "with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babiesâ mouths,\r\n",
      "when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\r\n",
      "and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\r\n",
      "simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\r\n",
      "even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\r\n",
      "and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\r\n",
      "She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\r\n",
      "it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\r\n",
      "sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\r\n",
      "head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\r\n",
      "snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\r\n",
      "second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\r\n",
      "as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\r\n",
      "and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\r\n",
      "difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\r\n",
      "absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\r\n",
      "perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\r\n",
      "that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\r\n",
      "have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\r\n",
      "not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\r\n",
      "done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\r\n",
      "stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\r\n",
      "into the room for anything in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\r\n",
      "possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\r\n",
      "was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\r\n",
      "kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\r\n",
      "him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\r\n",
      "He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\r\n",
      "that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\r\n",
      "in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\r\n",
      "blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\r\n",
      "there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\r\n",
      "with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\r\n",
      "then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\r\n",
      "There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\r\n",
      "carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\r\n",
      "possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\r\n",
      "his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\r\n",
      "nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\r\n",
      "But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\r\n",
      "quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\r\n",
      "room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\r\n",
      "that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\r\n",
      "of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\r\n",
      "utterly different from what he was now doing. âGood God!â he muttered âI\r\n",
      "must fly, fly,â and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\r\n",
      "awaited him such as he had never known before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\r\n",
      "door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\r\n",
      "was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\r\n",
      "all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\r\n",
      "perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\r\n",
      "afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\r\n",
      "she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\r\n",
      "staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\r\n",
      "two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\r\n",
      "âWhat are they about?â He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\r\n",
      "though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\r\n",
      "but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\r\n",
      "began going downstairs humming a tune. âHow is it they all make such\r\n",
      "a noise?â flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\r\n",
      "waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\r\n",
      "step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\r\n",
      "he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\r\n",
      "began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\r\n",
      "to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\r\n",
      "peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\r\n",
      "_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\r\n",
      "growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\r\n",
      "now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\r\n",
      "him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\r\n",
      "in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\r\n",
      "rooted to the spot and cannot even move oneâs arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\r\n",
      "started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\r\n",
      "flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\r\n",
      "noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\r\n",
      "done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\r\n",
      "visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\r\n",
      "another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\r\n",
      "the door divided them and he was listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor panted several times. âHe must be a big, fat man,â thought\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\r\n",
      "indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\r\n",
      "something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\r\n",
      "seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\r\n",
      "and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\r\n",
      "at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\r\n",
      "minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\r\n",
      "possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\r\n",
      "fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\r\n",
      "again. âI shall fall down!â flashed through his mind, but the unknown\r\n",
      "began to speak and he recovered himself at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhatâs up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!â he bawled in a\r\n",
      "thick voice, âHey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\r\n",
      "my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\r\n",
      "the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\r\n",
      "acquaintance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\r\n",
      "stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\r\n",
      "first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou donât say thereâs no one at home,â the new-comer cried in a\r\n",
      "cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\r\n",
      "pulling the bell. âGood evening, Koch.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFrom his voice he must be quite young,â thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho the devil can tell? Iâve almost broken the lock,â answered Koch.\r\n",
      "âBut how do you come to know me?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\r\n",
      "billiards at Gambrinusâ.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo they are not at home? Thatâs queer. Itâs awfully stupid though.\r\n",
      "Where could the old woman have gone? Iâve come on business.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes; and I have business with her, too.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\r\n",
      "get some money!â cried the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWe must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\r\n",
      "old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. Itâs out of my way.\r\n",
      "And where the devil she can have got to, I canât make out. She sits here\r\n",
      "from yearâs end to yearâs end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\r\n",
      "here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHadnât we better ask the porter?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhere sheâs gone and when sheâll be back.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\r\n",
      "anywhere.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he once more tugged at the door-handle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDamn it all. Thereâs nothing to be done, we must go!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStay!â cried the young man suddenly. âDo you see how the door shakes if\r\n",
      "you pull it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat shows itâs not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\r\n",
      "the hook clanks?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy, donât you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\r\n",
      "were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\r\n",
      "key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\r\n",
      "is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\r\n",
      "donât you see. So there they are sitting inside and donât open the\r\n",
      "door!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell! And so they must be!â cried Koch, astonished. âWhat are they\r\n",
      "about in there?â And he began furiously shaking the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âStay!â cried the young man again. âDonât pull at it! There must be\r\n",
      "something wrong.... Here, youâve been ringing and pulling at the door\r\n",
      "and still they donât open! So either theyâve both fainted or...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI tell you what. Letâs go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAll right.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "âIâm studying the law you see! Itâs evident, e-vi-dent thereâs something\r\n",
      "wrong here!â the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\r\n",
      "tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\r\n",
      "touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\r\n",
      "more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\r\n",
      "bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\r\n",
      "on the inside and so nothing could be seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\r\n",
      "delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\r\n",
      "While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\r\n",
      "occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\r\n",
      "door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\r\n",
      "while they could not open the door! âOnly make haste!â was the thought\r\n",
      "that flashed through his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut what the devil is he about?...â Time was passing, one minute, and\r\n",
      "another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat the devil?â he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\r\n",
      "sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\r\n",
      "boots on the stairs. The steps died away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood heavens! What am I to do?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\r\n",
      "Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\r\n",
      "thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\r\n",
      "below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\r\n",
      "back to the flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHey there! Catch the brute!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\r\n",
      "down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\r\n",
      "still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\r\n",
      "noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\r\n",
      "distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. âHey!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling âcome what\r\n",
      "must!â If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\r\n",
      "lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\r\n",
      "a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\r\n",
      "right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\r\n",
      "second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\r\n",
      "for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\r\n",
      "run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\r\n",
      "instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\r\n",
      "and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\r\n",
      "Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\r\n",
      "waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\r\n",
      "the gateway and turned to the left in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\r\n",
      "flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\r\n",
      "the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\r\n",
      "bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\r\n",
      "completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\r\n",
      "succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\r\n",
      "guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\r\n",
      "going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\r\n",
      "the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. âShould he\r\n",
      "slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\r\n",
      "hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\r\n",
      "hopeless!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\r\n",
      "Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\r\n",
      "because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\r\n",
      "grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\r\n",
      "scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\r\n",
      "âMy word, he has been going it!â someone shouted at him when he came out\r\n",
      "on the canal bank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\r\n",
      "worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\r\n",
      "bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\r\n",
      "conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\r\n",
      "falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\r\n",
      "quite a different direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\r\n",
      "house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\r\n",
      "And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\r\n",
      "escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\r\n",
      "incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\r\n",
      "restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebodyâs yard. But\r\n",
      "it all happened fortunately, the door of the porterâs room was closed\r\n",
      "but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\r\n",
      "home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\r\n",
      "walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\r\n",
      "âWhat do you want?â he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\r\n",
      "again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\r\n",
      "back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\r\n",
      "before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\r\n",
      "the landladyâs door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\r\n",
      "on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\r\n",
      "forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\r\n",
      "jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\r\n",
      "simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\r\n",

      "But there seemed to be nothing, no trace, except in one place, where\r\n",
      "some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\r\n",
      "of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\r\n",
      "threads. There seemed to be nothing more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\r\n",
      "the old womanâs box were still in his pockets! He had not thought till\r\n",
      "then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\r\n",
      "while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\r\n",
      "to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\r\n",
      "everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\r\n",
      "nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\r\n",
      "come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\r\n",
      "stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: âTheyâre in! All\r\n",
      "out of sight, and the purse too!â he thought gleefully, getting up and\r\n",
      "gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\r\n",
      "he shuddered all over with horror; âMy God!â he whispered in despair:\r\n",
      "âwhatâs the matter with me? Is that hidden? Is that the way to hide\r\n",
      "things?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not reckoned on having trinkets to hide. He had only thought of\r\n",
      "money, and so had not prepared a hiding-place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut now, now, what am I glad of?â he thought, âIs that hiding things?\r\n",
      "My reasonâs deserting me--simply!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\r\n",
      "unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\r\n",
      "him his old studentâs winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\r\n",
      "rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\r\n",
      "delirium. He lost consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\r\n",
      "and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\r\n",
      "taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\r\n",
      "Such a piece of evidence!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\r\n",
      "among his linen under the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPieces of torn linen couldnât rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\r\n",
      "think not, I think not, any way!â he repeated, standing in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\r\n",
      "him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\r\n",
      "forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\r\n",
      "and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\r\n",
      "insufferable torture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSurely it isnât beginning already! Surely it isnât my punishment coming\r\n",
      "upon me? It is!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\r\n",
      "floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat is the matter with me!â he cried again, like one distraught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\r\n",
      "were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\r\n",
      "stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\r\n",
      "his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\r\n",
      "clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\r\n",
      "purse too. âAh! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\r\n",
      "the wet purse in my pocket!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\r\n",
      "traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\r\n",
      "memory, since I guessed it of myself,â he thought triumphantly, with\r\n",
      "a deep sigh of relief; âitâs simply the weakness of fever, a momentâs\r\n",
      "delirium,â and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\r\n",
      "trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\r\n",
      "sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\r\n",
      "flung off his boots; âtraces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\r\n",
      "blood;â he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... âBut what am I\r\n",
      "to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\r\n",
      "But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\r\n",
      "go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,â he\r\n",
      "repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, âand at once, this minute,\r\n",
      "without lingering...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\r\n",
      "shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\r\n",
      "âgo off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\r\n",
      "it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!â Several times\r\n",
      "he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOpen, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!â shouted\r\n",
      "Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. âFor whole days together\r\n",

      "past ten.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMaybe heâs not at home,â said a manâs voice.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "positive pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen who can have latched the door?â retorted Nastasya. âHeâs taken to\r\n",

      "up!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\r\n",
      "desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\r\n",
      "paper sealed with bottle-wax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA notice from the office,â he announced, as he gave him the paper.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âA summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "go away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHeâs downright ill!â observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\r\n",
      "The porter turned his head for a moment. âHeâs been in a fever since\r\n",
      "yesterday,â she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\r\n",
      "opening it. âDonât you get up then,â Nastasya went on compassionately,\r\n",
      "seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. âYouâre ill, and\r\n",
      "so donât go; thereâs no such hurry. What have you got there?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\r\n",
      "trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\r\n",
      "with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\r\n",
      "half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\r\n",
      "and so fallen asleep again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLook at the rags heâs collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\r\n",
      "got hold of a treasure...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\r\n",
      "eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\r\n",
      "reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\r\n",
      "with a person who was going to be arrested. âBut... the police?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYouâd better have some tea! Yes? Iâll bring it, thereâs some left.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo... Iâm going; Iâll go at once,â he muttered, getting on to his feet.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She followed the porter out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\r\n",
      "and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\r\n",
      "distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\r\n",
      "thank God!â Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\r\n",
      "reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\r\n",
      "ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\r\n",
      "half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\r\n",
      "the police! And why just to-day?â he thought in agonising bewilderment.\r\n",
      "âGood God, only get it over soon!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\r\n",
      "laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began, hurriedly dressing. âIf Iâm lost, I am lost, I donât care!\r\n",
      "Shall I put the sock on?â he suddenly wondered, âit will get dustier\r\n",
      "still and the traces will be gone.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\r\n",
      "and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\r\n",
      "he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs all conventional, thatâs all relative, merely a way of looking\r\n",
      "at it,â he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\r\n",
      "mind, while he was shuddering all over, âthere, Iâve got it on! I have\r\n",
      "finished by getting it on!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, itâs too much for me...â he thought. His legs shook. âFrom fear,â\r\n",
      " he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. âItâs a trick! They\r\n",
      "want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,â he mused, as\r\n",
      "he went out on to the stairs--âthe worst of it is Iâm almost\r\n",
      "light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\r\n",
      "they were in the hole in the wall, âand very likely, itâs on purpose\r\n",
      "to search when Iâm out,â he thought, and stopped short. But he was\r\n",
      "possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\r\n",
      "it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. âOnly to get it over!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\r\n",
      "fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\r\n",
      "from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\r\n",
      "pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\r\n",
      "so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\r\n",
      "round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\r\n",
      "street on a bright sunny day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\r\n",
      "trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\r\n",
      "his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf they question me, perhaps Iâll simply tell,â he thought, as he drew\r\n",
      "near the police-station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\r\n",
      "moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\r\n",
      "for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\r\n",
      "he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\r\n",
      "a book in his hand. âA house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\r\n",
      "here,â and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\r\n",
      "to ask questions of anyone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIâll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...â he thought, as\r\n",
      "he reached the fourth floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\r\n",
      "kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\r\n",
      "the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\r\n",
      "was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\r\n",
      "arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\r\n",
      "the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\r\n",
      "too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\r\n",
      "paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\r\n",
      "All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\r\n",
      "on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\r\n",
      "clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\r\n",
      "queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat is it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He showed the notice he had received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou are a student?â the man asked, glancing at the notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, formerly a student.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\r\n",
      "particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\r\n",
      "interest in anything,â thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGo in there to the head clerk,â said the clerk, pointing towards the\r\n",
      "furthest room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\r\n",
      "packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\r\n",
      "Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\r\n",
      "table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\r\n",
      "The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\r\n",
      "excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\r\n",
      "saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\r\n",
      "at it, said: âWait a minute,â and went on attending to the lady in\r\n",
      "mourning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He breathed more freely. âIt canât be that!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\r\n",
      "courage and be calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSome foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\r\n",
      "Hm... itâs a pity thereâs no air here,â he added, âitâs stifling.... It\r\n",
      "makes oneâs head dizzier than ever... and oneâs mind too...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\r\n",
      "his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\r\n",
      "something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\r\n",
      "the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\r\n",
      "and guess something from his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\r\n",
      "face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\r\n",
      "foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\r\n",
      "and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\r\n",
      "on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\r\n",
      "was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLuise Ivanovna, you can sit down,â he said casually to the\r\n",
      "gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\r\n",
      "venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIch danke,â said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\r\n",
      "into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\r\n",
      "about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\r\n",
      "smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\r\n",
      "the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\r\n",
      "impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\r\n",
      "some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\r\n",
      "his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\r\n",
      "sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\r\n",
      "seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYouâre in a government office, too,â cried Raskolnikov, âand youâre\r\n",

      "to all of us.â\r\n",

      " But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\r\n",
      "worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\r\n",
      "read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\r\n",
      "all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\r\n",

      "last night? Eh! A disgrace again, youâre a scandal to the whole street.\r\n",

      "smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\r\n",
      "meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\r\n",
      "listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âIlya Petrovitch!â the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\r\n",

      "be stopped except by force.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThere was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,â she\r\n",

      "honour came drunk, and itâs the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\r\n",
      "scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\r\n",
      "again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\r\n",
      "with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\r\n",
      "he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\r\n",
      "so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\r\n",
      "I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\r\n",
      "eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\r\n",
      "cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\r\n",
      "the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\r\n",
      "squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\r\n",
      "And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\r\n",
      "Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\r\n",
      "pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\r\n",
      "roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\r\n",
      "all the scandal. âI will show you up,â he said, âfor I can write to all\r\n",

      "in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\r\n",
      "lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\r\n",
      "man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an âhonourable\r\n",
      "houseâ? A nice set, these authors!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. âThere was a scandal\r\n",
      "the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\r\n",
      "would not pay; âIâll write a satire on you,â says he. And there was\r\n",
      "another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\r\n",
      "language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\r\n",
      "daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectionerâs shop\r\n",
      "the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\r\n",
      "town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\r\n",
      "day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\r\n",
      "directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\r\n",
      "stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\r\n",
      "face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\r\n",
      "the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\r\n",
      "to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\r\n",
      "fluttered out of the office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "âWell, what then!â Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\r\n",

      "studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\r\n",
      "have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\r\n",

      "oblivious of him. âAllow me to explain that I have been living with her\r\n",

      "to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\r\n",
      "in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\r\n",
      "to carry it out. âHadnât I better think a minute?â flashed through his\r\n",

      "with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âBut excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\r\n",
      "themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\r\n",
      "later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\r\n",
      "unfastened.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\r\n",
      "in; and theyâd have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\r\n",
      "an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\r\n",
      "interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\r\n",
      "himself and saying: âIf I had been there, he would have jumped out and\r\n",

      "get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\r\n",
      "rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\r\n",
      "the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\r\n",
      "several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\r\n",
      "think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the stepsâ edge,\r\n",
      "and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\r\n",
      "people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\r\n",

      "fancy?â he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\r\n",
      "Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\r\n",
      "and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\r\n",
      "off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\r\n",
      "worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\r\n",
      "before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\r\n",
      "because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\r\n",
      "and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\r\n",
      "another idea struck him. âWhy to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\r\n",
      "somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\r\n",
      "in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\r\n",
      "perhaps?â And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\r\n",
      "seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\r\n",
      "coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\r\n",
      "passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\r\n",
      "hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\r\n",
      "into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\r\n",
      "twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\r\n",
      "was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\r\n",
      "lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\r\n",
      "apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\r\n",
      "was probably a carriage builderâs or carpenterâs shed; the whole place\r\n",
      "from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\r\n",
      "throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\r\n",
      "at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\r\n",
      "there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\r\n",
      "been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, âStanding here\r\n",
      "strictly forbidden.â This was all the better, for there would be nothing\r\n",
      "suspicious about his going in. âHere I could throw it all in a heap and\r\n",
      "get away!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\r\n",
      "against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\r\n",
      "stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\r\n",
      "street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\r\n",
      "could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\r\n",
      "street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\r\n",
      "and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\r\n",
      "hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\r\n",
      "The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\r\n",
      "seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\r\n",
      "in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\r\n",
      "he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\r\n",
      "Nothing could be noticed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\r\n",
      "almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\r\n",
      "the police-office. âI have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\r\n",
      "looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\r\n",
      "the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\r\n",
      "found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!â And he laughed.\r\n",
      "Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\r\n",
      "laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\r\n",
      "when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\r\n",
      "upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\r\n",
      "mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\r\n",
      "on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\r\n",
      "would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\r\n",
      "given the twenty copecks: âDamn him!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\r\n",
      "seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\r\n",
      "really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\r\n",
      "point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDamn it all!â he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\r\n",
      "âIf it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\r\n",
      "stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\r\n",
      "upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\r\n",
      "care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\r\n",
      "is not that at all!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\r\n",
      "question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\r\n",
      "I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\r\n",
      "glance into the purse and donât know what I had there, for which I have\r\n",
      "undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\r\n",
      "filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\r\n",
      "water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\r\n",
      "either... howâs that?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\r\n",
      "it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\r\n",
      "without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\r\n",
      "it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\r\n",
      "understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\r\n",
      "moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\r\n",
      "of it.... Yes, so it was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is because I am very ill,â he decided grimly at last, âI have been\r\n",
      "worrying and fretting myself, and I donât know what I am doing....\r\n",
      "Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\r\n",

      "if I donât get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\r\n",

      "overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\r\n",
      "every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\r\n",
      "everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\r\n",
      "All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\r\n",
      "other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\r\n",
      "his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs it you?â he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\r\n",
      "brief pause, he whistled. âAs hard up as all that! Why, brother, youâve\r\n",
      "cut me out!â he added, looking at Raskolnikovâs rags. âCome sit down,\r\n",
      "you are tired, Iâll be bound.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\r\n",

      "visitor was ill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy, you are seriously ill, do you know that?â He began feeling his\r\n",

      "âNever mind,â he said, âI have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\r\n",
      "wanted,... but I donât really want lessons....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut I say! You are delirious, you know!â Razumihin observed, watching\r\n",

      "âNo, I am not.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\r\n",
      "disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\r\n",
      "wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\r\n",

      "gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\r\n",
      "a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\r\n",
      "cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\r\n",
      "every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\r\n",
      "himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\r\n",
      "those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\r\n",
      "no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\r\n",
      "grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\r\n",
      "as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\r\n",
      "interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\r\n",
      "so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\r\n",

      "now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\r\n",
      "his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\r\n",
      "felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\r\n",
      "from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\r\n",
      "suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\r\n",
      "hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\r\n",

      "It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\r\n",

      "blows and curses he had never heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\r\n",
      "and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\r\n",
      "he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\r\n",
      "wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\r\n",
      "out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\r\n",
      "beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\r\n",
      "her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\r\n",
      "a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\r\n",
      "and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\r\n",
      "banging her head against the steps--thatâs clear, that can be told\r\n",
      "from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\r\n",
      "topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\r\n",
      "and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\r\n",
      "banging. âBut why, why, and how could it be?â he repeated, thinking\r\n",
      "seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\r\n",
      "they would come to him then next, âfor no doubt... itâs all about\r\n",
      "that... about yesterday.... Good God!â He would have fastened his door\r\n",
      "with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\r\n",
      "be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\r\n",
      "him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\r\n",
      "began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\r\n",
      "Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\r\n",
      "too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. âCan he have\r\n",
      "gone away? Good Lord!â Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\r\n",
      "weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\r\n",
      "going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\r\n",
      "to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\r\n",
      "whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\r\n",
      "of the block. âBut, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\r\n",

      "new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\r\n",
      "him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitchâs whole\r\n",
      "appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of âfiancÃ©â so\r\n",
      "unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\r\n",
      "too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\r\n",
      "days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\r\n",
      "of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\r\n",
      "indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\r\n",
      "agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\r\n",
      "circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rÃ´le of\r\n",
      "fiancÃ©. All his clothes were fresh from the tailorâs and were all\r\n",
      "right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\r\n",
      "the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\r\n",
      "exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\r\n",
      "if only from the fact of his not wearing them, but carrying them in\r\n",
      "his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitchâs attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\r\n",
      "light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\r\n",
      "cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\r\n",
      "of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\r\n",
      "handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\r\n",
      "His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\r\n",
      "growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\r\n",
      "touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\r\n",
      "at a hairdresserâs, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\r\n",
      "usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\r\n",
      "If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\r\n",
      "good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\r\n",
      "causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\r\n",
      "malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs in Voskresensky,â put in Razumihin. âThere are two storeys of\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "know him?â\r\n",

      "A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âIn the most serious and essential matters,â Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\r\n",
      "as though delighted at the question. âYou see, itâs ten years since I\r\n",
      "visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\r\n",
      "the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\r\n",
      "And itâs my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\r\n",
      "younger generation. And I confess I am delighted...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAt what?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYour question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\r\n",
      "clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs true,â Zossimov let drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNonsense! Thereâs no practicality.â Razumihin flew at him.\r\n",
      "âPracticality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\r\n",
      "heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\r\n",
      "all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,â he said to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI donât agree with you,â Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\r\n",
      "enjoyment. âOf course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\r\n",
      "but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\r\n",
      "enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\r\n",
      "has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\r\n",
      "Itâs my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\r\n",
      "accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\r\n",
      "circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\r\n",
      "Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\r\n",
      "rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\r\n",

      "triumph and superciliousness--he almost added âyoung manâ--âthat there\r\n",

      "the third storey and the fourth. âHere!â He was perplexed to find the\r\n",
      "door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\r\n",
      "he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\r\n",
      "stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\r\n",
      "workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\r\n",
      "would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\r\n",
      "same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\r\n",
      "strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\r\n",
      "were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\r\n",
      "other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\r\n",
      "lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\r\n",
      "some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\r\n",
      "with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\r\n",
      "The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\r\n",
      "hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\r\n",
      "no notice of Raskolnikovâs coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\r\n",

      "venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\r\n",

      "At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\r\n",
      "came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\r\n",

      "the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\r\n",
      "unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\r\n",
      "doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\r\n",
      "She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\r\n",
      "its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\r\n",
      "whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\r\n",
      "with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\r\n",
      "with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\r\n",
      "was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\r\n",
      "terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\r\n",
      "pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\r\n",
      "priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\r\n",
      "words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\r\n",
      "step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\r\n",

      "articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\r\n",
      "wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\r\n",

      "corner.\r\n",

      "all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\r\n",
      "friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\r\n",

      "cold and inhumanly callous; itâs as though he were alternating between\r\n",
      "two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\r\n",
      "so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\r\n",
      "nothing. He doesnât jeer at things, not because he hasnât the wit, but\r\n",
      "as though he hadnât time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\r\n",
      "to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\r\n",

      "attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\r\n",
      "arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\r\n",
      "without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\r\n",
      "what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\r\n",
      "white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\r\n",
      "extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\r\n",
      "like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\r\n",
      "just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\r\n",
      "of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\r\n",

      "supposed may be mistaken, but you canât imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\r\n",

      "he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\r\n",
      "do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\r\n",
      "instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\r\n",
      "me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âHe has never spoken a word of that affair to me,â Razumihin answered\r\n",
      "cautiously. âBut I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\r\n",
      "though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\r\n",
      "rather strange.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd what did you hear?â both the ladies asked at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "only failed to take place through the girlâs death, was not at all to\r\n",

      "pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\r\n",
      "queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\r\n",
      "had some good qualities or itâs quite inexplicable.... She had no money\r\n",
      "either and he wouldnât have considered her money.... But itâs always\r\n",
      "difficult to judge in such matters.â\r\n",

      "which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\r\n",
      "or she to him,â Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\r\n",

      "Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\r\n",
      "the latterâs annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\r\n",
      "caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\r\n",
      "detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\r\n",
      "blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\r\n",
      "seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe had planned it before his illness,â he added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI think so, too,â Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\r\n",
      "But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\r\n",

      "from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\r\n",
      "rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\r\n",

      "morning I am ashamed of it.â\r\n",

      "to speak of Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\r\n",
      "to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\r\n",

      "âOf course, mother,â said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis is what it is,â she began in haste, as though the permission to\r\n",

      "morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\r\n",
      "announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\r\n",
      "know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\r\n",
      "lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\r\n",

      "that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\r\n",
      "the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\r\n",
      "in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\r\n",
      "you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\r\n",
      "delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\r\n",

      "the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\r\n",
      "not later than to-morrow evening at eight oâclock precisely, and\r\n",
      "herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\r\n",
      "request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\r\n",
      "he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\r\n",
      "visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\r\n",
      "from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\r\n",
      "upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\r\n",
      "interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\r\n",

      "ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\r\n",
      "to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\r\n",
      "by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\r\n",
      "was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\r\n",
      "day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\r\n",
      "a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\r\n",
      "His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\r\n",
      "little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\r\n",
      "restlessness in his movements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\r\n",
      "the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\r\n",
      "pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\r\n",
      "entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\r\n",
      "place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\r\n",
      "of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\r\n",
      "with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\r\n",
      "in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\r\n",
      "bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\r\n",
      "torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\r\n",
      "conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\r\n",
      "at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\r\n",
      "and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\r\n",
      "monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, I see myself now that I am almost well,â said Raskolnikov,\r\n",

      "I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âI donât know how to thank him either,â Raskolnikov went on,\r\n",

      "payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\r\n",
      "really donât know what I have done to deserve such special attention\r\n",
      "from you! I simply donât understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âDonât be irritated.â Zossimov forced himself to laugh. âAssume that you\r\n",

      "our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\r\n",

      "trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\r\n",

      "yesterday, waiting for me to come back.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\r\n",
      "I am afraid.... Oh, dear, heâs so strange! Heâs talking kindly, but Iâm\r\n",
      "afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...â\r\n",

      "canât remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\r\n",
      "and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldnât pull him out\r\n",
      "till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\r\n",
      "rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\r\n",
      "alone, utterly alone,â she said plaintively and stopped short,\r\n",

      "him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\r\n",
      "and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He\r\n",
      "stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled\r\n",
      "flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and\r\n",
      "they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat is it?â Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him\r\n",
      "attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the\r\n",
      "gate into the street without saying a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat is it?â cried Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your\r\n",
      "name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of\r\n",
      "him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,\r\n",
      "deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\r\n",
      "meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.\r\n",
      "At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man\r\n",
      "noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;\r\n",
      "and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou were inquiring for me... of the porter?â Raskolnikov said at last,\r\n",
      "but in a curiously quiet voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man made no answer; he didnât even look at him. Again they were both\r\n",
      "silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhy do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... Whatâs the\r\n",
      "meaning of it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikovâs voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words\r\n",
      "clearly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMurderer!â he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\r\n",
      "cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\r\n",
      "a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\r\n",
      "they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man did not look at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?â muttered\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "â_You_ are a murderer,â the man answered still more articulately and\r\n",
      "emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\r\n",
      "straight into Raskolnikovâs pale face and stricken eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\r\n",
      "without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\r\n",
      "him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\r\n",
      "standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\r\n",
      "he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\r\n",
      "back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\r\n",
      "and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\r\n",
      "Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\r\n",
      "stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\r\n",
      "images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\r\n",
      "people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\r\n",
      "never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\r\n",
      "in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\r\n",
      "in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\r\n",
      "dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\r\n",
      "Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\r\n",
      "another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\r\n",
      "to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\r\n",
      "within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\r\n",
      "pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\r\n",
      "was an almost pleasant sensation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\r\n",
      "pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\r\n",
      "time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\r\n",
      "the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasyaâs\r\n",
      "whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDonât disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âQuite so,â answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\r\n",
      "door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\r\n",
      "his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,\r\n",
      "what did he see? He has seen it all, thatâs clear. Where was he then?\r\n",
      "And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?\r\n",
      "And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...â continued Raskolnikov,\r\n",
      "turning cold and shivering, âand the jewel case Nikolay found behind the\r\n",
      "door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you\r\n",
      "can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it\r\n",
      "possible?â He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he\r\n",
      "had become. âI ought to have known it,â he thought with a bitter smile.\r\n",
      "âAnd how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an\r\n",
      "axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did\r\n",
      "know!â he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is\r\n",
      "permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in\r\n",
      "Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off\r\n",
      "with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and\r\n",
      "so _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but\r\n",
      "of bronze!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the\r\n",
      "pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with\r\n",
      "a red trunk under her bed--itâs a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to\r\n",
      "digest! How can they digest it! Itâs too inartistic. âA Napoleon creep\r\n",
      "under an old womanâs bed! Ugh, how loathsome!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish\r\n",
      "excitement. âThe old woman is of no consequence,â he thought, hotly and\r\n",
      "incoherently. âThe old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not\r\n",
      "what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\r\n",
      "overstep.... I didnât kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the\r\n",
      "principle, but I didnât overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was\r\n",
      "only capable of killing. And it seems I wasnât even capable of that...\r\n",
      "Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are\r\n",
      "industrious, commercial people; âthe happiness of allâ is their case.\r\n",
      "No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I\r\n",
      "donât want to wait for âthe happiness of all.â I want to live myself,\r\n",
      "or else better not live at all. I simply couldnât pass by my mother\r\n",
      "starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the\r\n",
      "âhappiness of all.â I am putting my little brick into the happiness of\r\n",
      "all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\r\n",
      "live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an Ã¦sthetic louse and nothing\r\n",
      "more,â he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. âYes, I am certainly a\r\n",
      "louse,â he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing\r\n",
      "with it with vindictive pleasure. âIn the first place, because I can\r\n",
      "reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been\r\n",
      "troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for\r\n",
      "my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble\r\n",
      "object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as\r\n",
      "possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked\r\n",
      "out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I\r\n",
      "needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone\r\n",
      "to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I\r\n",
      "am utterly a louse,â he added, grinding his teeth, âis that I am\r\n",
      "perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt\r\n",
      "beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can\r\n",
      "anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The\r\n",
      "abjectness! I understand the âprophetâ with his sabre, on his steed:\r\n",
      "Allah commands and âtremblingâ creation must obey! The âprophetâ is\r\n",
      "right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up\r\n",
      "the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! Itâs for you to\r\n",
      "obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for thatâs not for\r\n",
      "you!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his\r\n",
      "eyes were fixed on the ceiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate\r\n",
      "them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I canât bear them near me....\r\n",
      "I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her\r\n",
      "and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? Thatâs just what\r\n",
      "I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,â he added, straining\r\n",
      "himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. âAh, how I hate\r\n",
      "the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!\r\n",

      "He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didnât remember\r\n",
      "how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen\r\n",
      "and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a\r\n",
      "peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the\r\n",
      "street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other\r\n",
      "people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and\r\n",
      "stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was\r\n",
      "distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do\r\n",
      "something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he\r\n",
      "stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,\r\n",
      "beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and\r\n",
      "walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to\r\n",
      "him. âStay, did he really beckon?â Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried\r\n",
      "to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\r\n",
      "was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\r\n",
      "coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\r\n",
      "they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. âDoes he\r\n",
      "know I am following him?â thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\r\n",
      "gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\r\n",
      "to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\r\n",
      "the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\r\n",
      "once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\r\n",
      "gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\r\n",
      "slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\r\n",
      "familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\r\n",
      "through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\r\n",
      "reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\r\n",
      "at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\r\n",
      "of the man above had died away. âSo he must have stopped or hidden\r\n",
      "somewhere.â He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\r\n",
      "stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\r\n",
      "footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\r\n",
      "hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\r\n",
      "hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\r\n",
      "though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\r\n",
      "which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\r\n",
      "chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\r\n",
      "frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\r\n",
      "âItâs the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,â thought\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\r\n",
      "silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\r\n",
      "painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\r\n",
      "crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\r\n",
      "flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\r\n",
      "that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\r\n",
      "cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. âWhy is that cloak\r\n",
      "here?â he thought, âit wasnât there before....â He went up to it quietly\r\n",
      "and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\r\n",
      "the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\r\n",
      "double so that he couldnât see her face; but it was she. He stood over\r\n",
      "her. âShe is afraid,â he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\r\n",
      "noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\r\n",
      "to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\r\n",
      "frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\r\n",
      "bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\r\n",
      "into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\r\n",
      "woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\r\n",
      "her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\r\n",
      "from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\r\n",
      "whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\r\n",
      "old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\r\n",
      "the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\r\n",
      "woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\r\n",
      "passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\r\n",
      "landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\r\n",
      "heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\r\n",
      "Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\r\n",
      "would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\r\n",
      "his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\r\n",
      "doorway watching him intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them\r\n",
      "again. He lay on his back without stirring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs it still a dream?â he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\r\n",
      "perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\r\n",
      "him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\r\n",
      "put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\r\n",
      "and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\r\n",
      "indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\r\n",
      "glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\r\n",
      "whitish beard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\r\n",
      "was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\r\n",
      "Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\r\n",
      "unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\r\n",

      "this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\r\n",
      "out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\r\n",
      "angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\r\n",
      "The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\r\n",
      "furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\r\n",
      "beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\r\n",
      "blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\r\n",
      "flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\r\n",

      "looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\r\n",

      "tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,\r\n",
      "have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her\r\n",
      "up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched\r\n",

      "be!â he cried, as Sonia had just before. âNo, what has kept her from the\r\n",
      "canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she\r\n",
      "has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her\r\n",
      "mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?\r\n",

      "blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that\r\n",
      "little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed\r\n",
      "to him more and more strange, almost impossible. âShe is a religious\r\n",

      "For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;\r\n",

      "He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some\r\n",
      "moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back\r\n",

      "staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\r\n",

      "on Raskolnikov again.\r\n",

      "waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\r\n",
      "on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\r\n",
      "collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\r\n",
      "was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\r\n",
      "amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolayâs confession\r\n",
      "was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\r\n",
      "once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\r\n",

      "Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with\r\n",

      "he did not yet know all Porfiryâs aims, he could not see into all his\r\n",
      "calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\r\n",
      "better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiryâs âleadâ had been for\r\n",
      "him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\r\n",
      "circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\r\n",
      "glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\r\n",
      "bound to win. Thereâs no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\r\n",
      "himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\r\n",
      "nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasnât\r\n",

      "That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\r\n",
      "young friendâs account. He had set down a good many points against him\r\n",
      "of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\r\n",
      "have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterdayâs interview.\r\n",
      "That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\r\n",
      "and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\r\n",
      "followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\r\n",
      "in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\r\n",
      "which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\r\n",
      "redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\r\n",
      "would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\r\n",
      "been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\r\n",
      "the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\r\n",
      "instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\r\n",

      "âIt was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,â he thought, as\r\n",
      "he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikovâs room, âand why on earth was I\r\n",
      "such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\r\n",

      "heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\r\n",
      "lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\r\n",

      "his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\r\n",
      "important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\r\n",
      "great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\r\n",
      "very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\r\n",
      "she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\r\n",
      "was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\r\n",
      "went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikovâs, somewhat thoughtful. He\r\n",
      "had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\r\n",
      "with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\r\n",
      "had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\r\n",
      "parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\r\n",
      "of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\r\n",
      "progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\r\n",
      "circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\r\n",
      "impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\r\n",
      "despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\r\n",
      "peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\r\n",
      "even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\r\n",
      "heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\r\n",
      "sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\r\n",
      "distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\r\n",
      "many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\r\n",
      "up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\r\n",
      "thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\r\n",
      "this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\r\n",
      "when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\r\n",
      "in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\r\n",
      "had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\r\n",
      "for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\r\n",
      "trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\r\n",
      "subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\r\n",
      "anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of âour younger\r\n",
      "generation.â He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\r\n",
      "his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\r\n",
      "phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\r\n",
      "simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\r\n",
      "had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\r\n",
      "would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\r\n",
      "systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\r\n",
      "him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\r\n",
      "was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything\r\n",
      "to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\r\n",
      "precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\r\n",
      "to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\r\n",
      "thing to do or not? Couldnât he gain something through them? In fact\r\n",
      "hundreds of questions presented themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch was an anÃ¦mic, scrofulous little man, with strangely\r\n",
      "flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk\r\n",
      "and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather\r\n",
      "soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\r\n",
      "speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\r\n",
      "He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\r\n",
      "not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\r\n",
      "really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\r\n",
      "and âour younger generationâ from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\r\n",
      "and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,\r\n",

      "Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to\r\n",
      "listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\r\n",

      "simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\r\n",
      "any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\r\n",
      "third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\r\n",

      "the landlady, âand you too, sausage eater, you declare that she is a\r\n",
      "thief, you trashy Prussian henâs leg in a crinoline! She hasnât been\r\n",
      "out of this room: she came straight from you, you wretch, and sat down\r\n",
      "beside me, everyone saw her. She sat here, by Rodion Romanovitch. Search\r\n",

      "any case itâs difficult for a man... on account of her sex.... But with\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And Katerina Ivanovna turned--or rather snatched--both pockets inside\r\n",
      "out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing\r\n",
      "a parabola in the air fell at Luzhinâs feet. Everyone saw it, several\r\n",
      "cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two\r\n",
      "fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a\r\n",
      "hundred-rouble note folded in eight. Pyotr Petrovitch held up the note\r\n",

      "Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel\r\n",
      "surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry\r\n",
      "and hid her face in her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, it wasnât I! I didnât take it! I know nothing about it,â she cried\r\n",
      "with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âSonia! Sonia! I donât believe it! You see, I donât believe it!â she\r\n",

      "arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her\r\n",
      "hands and kissing them, too, âyou took it! How stupid these people are!\r\n",
      "Oh dear! You are fools, fools,â she cried, addressing the whole room,\r\n",

      "you if you needed it, thatâs what she is! She has the yellow passport\r\n",
      "because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,\r\n",

      "Merciful heavens! Defend her, why are you all standing still? Rodion\r\n",

      "as a childâs, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help\r\n",

      "her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous\r\n",
      "idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,\r\n",
      "so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to\r\n",

      "not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\r\n",
      "only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\r\n",
      "the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\r\n",
      "suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\r\n",
      "doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\r\n",
      "her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\r\n",
      "him as though she were expecting him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWell, Sonia?â he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, âit was\r\n",

      "Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou canât guess, then?â he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\r\n",
      "heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\r\n",
      "face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizavetaâs\r\n",
      "face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\r\n",
      "wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\r\n",
      "as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\r\n",
      "looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\r\n",
      "holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\r\n",
      "thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\r\n",
      "terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\r\n",
      "hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\r\n",
      "get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\r\n",
      "even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\r\n",
      "showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\r\n",
      "with the same _childish_ smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHave you guessed?â he whispered at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGood God!â broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\r\n",
      "moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\r\n",
      "and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\r\n",
      "face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\r\n",
      "tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\r\n",
      "there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\r\n",

      "down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\r\n",

      "âThere is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!â she\r\n",
      "cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\r\n",
      "violent hysterical weeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\r\n",
      "once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\r\n",
      "and hung on his eyelashes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, no, never, nowhere!â cried Sonia. âI will follow you, I will follow\r\n",

      "knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\r\n",

      "not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... thatâs\r\n",
      "not the real thing either.... Donât torture me, Sonia.â\r\n",

      "rob and murder! Ah,â she cried suddenly, âthat money you gave Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, Sonia,â he broke in hurriedly, âthat money was not it. Donât worry\r\n",
      "yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\r\n",
      "day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\r\n",

      "money,â he added softly, as though reflecting. âI took a purse off her\r\n",
      "neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\r\n",
      "but I didnât look in it; I suppose I hadnât time.... And the\r\n",

      "of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\r\n",

      "other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\r\n",

      "to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\r\n",
      "of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\r\n",
      "terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\r\n",
      "seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\r\n",
      "from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\r\n",
      "facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\r\n",

      "himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\r\n",
      "eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\r\n",

      "had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "there were things they must talk over....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. SvidrigaÃ¯lov\r\n",
      "looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\r\n",
      "dropping his voice, asked: âBut how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\r\n",
      "donât seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you donât seem to\r\n",
      "understand. Cheer up! Weâll talk things over; I am only sorry, Iâve\r\n",

      "went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\r\n",
      "the priest into Soniaâs room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\r\n",
      "slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\r\n",
      "thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\r\n",
      "and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\r\n",

      "the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, âGive rest, oh Lord....â\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\r\n",
      "took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\r\n",
      "head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\r\n",
      "repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\r\n",
      "furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\r\n",
      "very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\r\n",
      "would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\r\n",
      "there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\r\n",
      "never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\r\n",
      "the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\r\n",
      "the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\r\n",
      "him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\r\n",
      "made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\r\n",
      "restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\r\n",
      "easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\r\n",
      "listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\r\n",
      "enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\r\n",
      "as though his conscience smote him. âHere I sit listening to singing,\r\n",
      "is that what I ought to be doing?â he thought. Yet he felt at once\r\n",
      "that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\r\n",
      "requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\r\n",
      "understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. âNo, better the\r\n",
      "struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or SvidrigaÃ¯lov.... Better some\r\n",
      "challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!â he thought. He went out of\r\n",
      "the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\r\n",
      "his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\r\n",
      "up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\r\n",
      "all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\r\n",
      "arrived. After some hoursâ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\r\n",
      "late, two oâclock in the afternoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remembered that Katerina Ivanovnaâs funeral had been fixed for that\r\n",
      "day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\r\n",
      "some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\r\n",
      "head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\r\n",
      "days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door opened and Razumihin came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh, heâs eating, then heâs not ill,â said Razumihin. He took a chair\r\n",
      "and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\r\n",
      "annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though\r\n",
      "he had some special fixed determination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âListen,â he began resolutely. âAs far as I am concerned, you may all go\r\n",
      "to hell, but from what I see, itâs clear to me that I canât make head or\r\n",
      "tail of it; please donât think Iâve come to ask you questions. I donât\r\n",
      "want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\r\n",

      "repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\r\n",

      "couldnât let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm.\r\n",
      "We came in, you werenât here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes,\r\n",
      "while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: âIf heâs\r\n",
      "gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, itâs\r\n",
      "humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for\r\n",

      "Sofya Semyonovna trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I\r\n",
      "apologised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. So thatâs all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In any case he must see SvidrigaÃ¯lov as soon as possible, he decided\r\n",

      "A sudden anguish oppressed his heart, he stood still in the middle of\r\n",

      "the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\r\n",
      "the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\r\n",
      "open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\r\n",
      "full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\r\n",
      "violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.\r\n",
      "He was about to turn back wondering why he had come to the X. Prospect,\r\n",

      "absent-mindedly away, while he watched him out of the corner of his eye.\r\n",
      "His heart was beating violently. Yet, it was evident that SvidrigaÃ¯lov\r\n",

      "chair, he seemed to have become suddenly aware that Raskolnikov had seen\r\n",
      "him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the\r\n",
      "same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikovâs room. A\r\n",
      "sly smile came into SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs face and grew broader and\r\n",
      "broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov broke into a loud laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the\r\n",
      "desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\r\n",
      "could be heard in the distance. On the table before SvidrigaÃ¯lov stood\r\n",
      "an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\r\n",
      "also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\r\n",
      "of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\r\n",
      "ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\r\n",
      "servantsâ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of\r\n",
      "the organ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCome, thatâs enough,â SvidrigaÃ¯lov stopped her at Raskolnikovâs\r\n",
      "entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.\r\n",
      "She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,\r\n",
      "in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed SvidrigaÃ¯lovâs hand, which he\r\n",
      "allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed\r\n",
      "after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\r\n",

      "was by now an old friend and very obsequious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. SvidrigaÃ¯lov was at\r\n",

      "just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay\r\n",

      "that it may be only chance. And what cowards they all are here, about\r\n",

      "apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\r\n",
      "for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\r\n",

      "mechanically on your memory. You turned this way mechanically and yet\r\n",
      "precisely according to the direction, though you are not aware of\r\n",
      "it. When I told you then, I hardly hoped you understood me. You give\r\n",

      "convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\r\n",

      "where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul\r\n",
      "of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much.\r\n",
      "And itâs the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must\r\n",
      "be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there\r\n",
      "now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out\r\n",
      "of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it\r\n",
      "sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see\r\n",
      "nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and\r\n",
      "talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at\r\n",
      "last stand still in the middle of the road. Thatâs not at all the thing.\r\n",
      "Someone may be watching you besides me, and it wonât do you any good.\r\n",

      "came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\r\n",
      "tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\r\n",

      "and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are\r\n",
      "amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From\r\n",
      "the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be\r\n",

      "left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\r\n",

      "three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\r\n",
      "âVauxhall,â which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\r\n",

      "a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\r\n",
      "possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\r\n",
      "that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\r\n",
      "selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\r\n",
      "companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\r\n",
      "belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\r\n",
      "troublesome. SvidrigaÃ¯lov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\r\n",
      "the garden. It was about six oâclock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\r\n",
      "all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\r\n",
      "the sky about ten oâclock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\r\n",
      "came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\r\n",

      "arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\r\n",

      "wildly at him, and started.) âDonât be uneasy, I know all about it from\r\n",
      "himself and I am not a gossip; I wonât tell anyone. It was good advice\r\n",
      "when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\r\n",

      "Youâll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\r\n",

      "heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovnaâs debt and not\r\n",
      "yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at SvidrigaÃ¯lov.\r\n",

      "apprehension.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,\r\n",
      "he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\r\n",
      "persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\r\n",
      "the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\r\n",
      "Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\r\n",
      "at first caused great perturbation; but SvidrigaÃ¯lov could be\r\n",
      "very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\r\n",
      "intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that SvidrigaÃ¯lov had\r\n",
      "probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\r\n",
      "vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\r\n",
      "conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\r\n",
      "question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\r\n",
      "were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when SvidrigaÃ¯lov\r\n",
      "would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\r\n",
      "almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\r\n",
      "by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\r\n",
      "occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\r\n",
      "betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\r\n",
      "had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important\r\n",
      "affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her\r\n",
      "fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\r\n",
      "him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\r\n",
      "before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\r\n",
      "immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\r\n",
      "purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\r\n",
      "off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\r\n",
      "the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\r\n",
      "other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\r\n",
      "by tears from the most sensible of mothers. SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up,\r\n",
      "laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\r\n",
      "come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\r\n",
      "sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\r\n",
      "he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\r\n",
      "immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\r\n",
      "went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\r\n",
      "the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\r\n",
      "the most important of their doubts, concluding that SvidrigaÃ¯lov was\r\n",
      "a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\r\n",
      "wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\r\n",
      "off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\r\n",
      "there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\r\n",
      "was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\r\n",
      "and all these people of high society didnât think of what was said of\r\n",
      "them and didnât stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\r\n",
      "on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\r\n",
      "word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\r\n",
      "the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\r\n",
      "cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\r\n",
      "to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\r\n",
      "whispering till two oâclock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,\r\n",
      "amazed and rather sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\r\n",
      "way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\r\n",
      "wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\r\n",
      "waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\r\n",
      "But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\r\n",
      "went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\r\n",
      "time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\r\n",
      "wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\r\n",
      "of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\r\n",
      "there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\r\n",
      "large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\r\n",
      "not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\r\n",
      "that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\r\n",
      "blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\r\n",
      "lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\r\n",
      "a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\r\n",
      "scanning SvidrigaÃ¯lov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\r\n",
      "close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\r\n",
      "the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\r\n",
      "looked inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs there tea?â asked SvidrigaÃ¯lov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, sir.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat else is there?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âVeal, vodka, savouries.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBring me tea and veal.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd you want nothing else?â he asked with apparent surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNothing, nothing.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt must be a nice place,â thought SvidrigaÃ¯lov. âHow was it I didnât\r\n",
      "know it? I expect I look as if I came from a cafÃ© chantant and have\r\n",
      "had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\r\n",
      "here?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\r\n",
      "room so low-pitched that SvidrigaÃ¯lov could only just stand up in it;\r\n",
      "it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\r\n",
      "chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\r\n",
      "were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\r\n",
      "that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\r\n",
      "colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\r\n",
      "by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\r\n",
      "the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\r\n",
      "thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\r\n",
      "in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\r\n",
      "the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\r\n",
      "almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\r\n",
      "light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\r\n",
      "room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\r\n",
      "them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\r\n",
      "in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\r\n",
      "preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\r\n",
      "the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\r\n",
      "declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\r\n",
      "him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\r\n",
      "all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\r\n",
      "air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but canât. He sometimes\r\n",
      "turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\r\n",
      "the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\r\n",
      "candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\r\n",
      "empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\r\n",
      "of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, SvidrigaÃ¯lov turned away\r\n",
      "indifferently and sat down on the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\r\n",
      "him again whether he didnât want anything more, and again receiving a\r\n",
      "negative reply, finally withdrew. SvidrigaÃ¯lov made haste to drink a\r\n",
      "glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\r\n",
      "to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\r\n",
      "blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. âIt would have been better\r\n",
      "to be well for the occasion,â he thought with a smile. The room was\r\n",
      "close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\r\n",
      "a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\r\n",
      "leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\r\n",
      "felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. âIt must be a garden\r\n",
      "under the window,â he thought. âThereâs a sound of trees. How I dislike\r\n",
      "the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\r\n",
      "horrid feeling.â He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\r\n",
      "Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\r\n",
      "Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. âI never have\r\n",
      "liked water,â he thought, âeven in a landscape,â and he suddenly smiled\r\n",
      "again at a strange idea: âSurely now all these questions of taste and\r\n",
      "comfort ought not to matter, but Iâve become more particular, like an\r\n",
      "animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\r\n",
      "to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\r\n",
      "ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\r\n",
      "havenât I put out the candle?â he blew it out. âTheyâve gone to bed next\r\n",
      "door,â he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. âWell, now, Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; itâs dark, and the very\r\n",
      "time and place for you. But now you wonât come!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\r\n",
      "Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihinâs\r\n",
      "keeping. âI suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\r\n",
      "tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! Heâs gone through a\r\n",
      "good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when heâs got over\r\n",
      "his nonsense. But now heâs _too_ eager for life. These young men\r\n",
      "are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\r\n",
      "himself, itâs nothing to do with me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could not get to sleep. By degrees Douniaâs image rose before him,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\r\n",
      "window. âItâs better not to sleep at all,â he decided. There was a cold\r\n",
      "damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\r\n",
      "blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\r\n",
      "anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\r\n",
      "incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\r\n",

      "the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\r\n",
      "roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\r\n",
      "on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\r\n",
      "warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\r\n",
      "cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\r\n",
      "flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\r\n",
      "surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\r\n",
      "rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\r\n",
      "particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\r\n",
      "narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\r\n",
      "reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\r\n",
      "into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\r\n",
      "the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\r\n",
      "The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\r\n",
      "were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\r\n",
      "chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\r\n",
      "covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\r\n",
      "covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\r\n",
      "flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\r\n",
      "white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\r\n",
      "though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\r\n",
      "a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\r\n",
      "her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\r\n",
      "pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\r\n",
      "beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\r\n",
      "She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\r\n",
      "herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\r\n",
      "soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\r\n",
      "from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\r\n",
      "a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\r\n",
      "window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\r\n",
      "into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\r\n",
      "his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\r\n",
      "something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\r\n",
      "probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\r\n",
      "rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\r\n",
      "in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\r\n",
      "objects. SvidrigaÃ¯lov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\r\n",
      "gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\r\n",
      "by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. âAh, the\r\n",
      "signal! The river is overflowing,â he thought. âBy morning it will be\r\n",
      "swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\r\n",
      "cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\r\n",
      "and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\r\n",
      "it now?â And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\r\n",
      "the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? Iâll go out at once\r\n",
      "straight to the park. Iâll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\r\n",
      "so that as soon as oneâs shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\r\n",
      "oneâs head.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\r\n",
      "waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\r\n",
      "into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\r\n",
      "somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\r\n",
      "him for the room and leave the hotel. âItâs the best minute; I couldnât\r\n",
      "choose a better.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\r\n",
      "anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\r\n",
      "between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\r\n",
      "which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\r\n",
      "girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\r\n",
      "clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\r\n",
      "black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\r\n",
      "crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The childâs face\r\n",
      "was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. âHow can she have come here?\r\n",
      "She must have hidden here and not slept all night.â He began questioning\r\n",
      "her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\r\n",
      "language, something about âmammyâ and that âmammy would beat her,â and\r\n",
      "about some cup that she had âbwoken.â The child chattered on without\r\n",
      "stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\r\n",
      "neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\r\n",
      "of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\r\n",
      "a cup of her motherâs and was so frightened that she had run away the\r\n",
      "evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the\r\n",
      "rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and\r\n",
      "spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness\r\n",
      "and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\r\n",
      "arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\r\n",
      "her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\r\n",
      "wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\r\n",
      "undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\r\n",
      "the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\r\n",
      "sank into dreary musing again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat folly to trouble myself,â he decided suddenly with an oppressive\r\n",
      "feeling of annoyance. âWhat idiocy!â In vexation he took up the candle\r\n",
      "to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\r\n",
      "âDamn the child!â he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\r\n",
      "to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\r\n",
      "The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\r\n",
      "and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\r\n",
      "brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. âItâs a flush\r\n",
      "of fever,â thought SvidrigaÃ¯lov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\r\n",
      "though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\r\n",
      "hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\r\n",
      "black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\r\n",
      "sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\r\n",
      "girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\r\n",
      "a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\r\n",
      "control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\r\n",
      "a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\r\n",
      "unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\r\n",
      "shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\r\n",
      "turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\r\n",
      "him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\r\n",
      "laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. âWhat,\r\n",
      "at five years old?â SvidrigaÃ¯lov muttered in genuine horror. âWhat does\r\n",
      "it mean?â And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\r\n",
      "out her arms.... âAccursed child!â SvidrigaÃ¯lov cried, raising his hand\r\n",
      "to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\r\n",
      "been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIâve had nightmare all night!â He got up angrily, feeling utterly\r\n",
      "shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\r\n",
      "see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\r\n",
      "put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\r\n",
      "pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\r\n",
      "pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\r\n",
      "lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\r\n",
      "elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\r\n",
      "flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\r\n",
      "the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\r\n",
      "trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\r\n",
      "At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\r\n",
      "started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\r\n",
      "was in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A thick milky mist hung over the town. SvidrigaÃ¯lov walked along the\r\n",
      "slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\r\n",
      "the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\r\n",
      "the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\r\n",
      "bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\r\n",
      "of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\r\n",
      "The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\r\n",
      "their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\r\n",
      "he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\r\n",
      "each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\r\n",
      "came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\r\n",
      "its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\r\n",
      "drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\r\n",
      "stood up on the left. âBah!â he shouted, âhere is a place. Why should\r\n",
      "it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\r\n",
      "anyway....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\r\n",
      "there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of\r\n",
      "the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\r\n",
      "wrapped in a grey soldierâs coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\r\n",
      "head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at SvidrigaÃ¯lov. His\r\n",
      "face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly\r\n",
      "printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\r\n",
      "SvidrigaÃ¯lov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\r\n",
      "without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man\r\n",
      "not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a\r\n",
      "word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "his way to his motherâs and sisterâs lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyevâs\r\n",
      "house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from\r\n",

      "nightâs rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\r\n",
      "inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all\r\n",

      "Sonia had been waiting for him in terrible anxiety. Dounia had been\r\n",

      "the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both\r\n",
      "were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each\r\n",

      "of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively\r\n",
      "clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came\r\n",

      "round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a\r\n",
      "glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt\r\n",

      "here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but\r\n",
      "still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to\r\n",

      "use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\r\n",

      "seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\r\n",
      "some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\r\n",
      "damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\r\n",
      "should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\r\n",
      "a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\r\n",
      "more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\r\n",
      "not looked into the purse, and so didnât know what was in it when he\r\n",
      "hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\r\n",
      "the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\r\n",
      "derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\r\n",
      "gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\r\n",
      "insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\r\n",
      "Raskolnikovâs hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\r\n",
      "Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\r\n",
      "All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\r\n",
      "quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\r\n",
      "element in the case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\r\n",
      "criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\r\n",
      "as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\r\n",
      "answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\r\n",
      "his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\r\n",
      "provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\r\n",
      "roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\r\n",
      "through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\r\n",
      "privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\r\n",
      "answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\r\n",
      "coarse....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\r\n",
      "perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\r\n",
      "but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\r\n",
      "and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\r\n",
      "There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\r\n",
      "of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\r\n",
      "had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\r\n",
      "abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\r\n",
      "murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\r\n",
      "commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the\r\n",
      "confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\r\n",
      "the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\r\n",
      "and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\r\n",
      "suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\r\n",
      "much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisonerâs\r\n",
      "favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and\r\n",
      "proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\r\n",
      "consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\r\n",
      "him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\r\n",
      "old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\r\n",
      "when he died. Raskolnikovâs landlady bore witness, too, that when they\r\n",
      "had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\r\n",
      "little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was\r\n",
      "investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts\r\n",
      "made an impression in his favour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating\r\n",

      "term of eight years only.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikovâs mother fell ill. Dounia\r\n",
      "and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\r\n",

      "as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time\r\n",
      "to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovnaâs\r\n",

      "that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\r\n",
      "had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\r\n",
      "in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\r\n",

      "Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\r\n",

      "continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\r\n",
      "with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\r\n",
      "obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\r\n",
      "her suspicions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovnaâs strange\r\n",

      "getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\r\n",
      "on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\r\n",

      "suspected that there was something terrible in her sonâs fate and was\r\n",
      "afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any\r\n",
      "case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\r\n",
      "her faculties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\r\n",
      "such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\r\n",
      "without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\r\n",
      "suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\r\n",
      "lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\r\n",
      "her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\r\n",
      "silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\r\n",

      "sleep on the night after her interview with SvidrigaÃ¯lov and before the\r\n",
      "fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?\r\n",
      "Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\r\n",
      "succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\r\n",

      "the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the\r\n",
      "separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in\r\n",
      "his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\r\n",

      "Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\r\n",
      "had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\r\n",
      "rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\r\n",
      "almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\r\n",
      "she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him\r\n",

      "that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was\r\n",
      "the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They\r\n",
      "seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at\r\n",
      "him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his\r\n",
      "isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons\r\n",
      "were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political\r\n",

      "and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\r\n",
      "had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\r\n",
      "moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\r\n",
      "went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\r\n",

      "looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\r\n",

      "the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\r\n",
      "and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\r\n",

      "summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\r\n",
      "because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\r\n",
      "could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\r\n",
      "on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\r\n",
      "quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\r\n",
      "fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\r\n",
      "men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\r\n",
      "moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\r\n",
      "world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\r\n",

      "and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up\r\n",
      "noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\r\n",
      "morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the\r\n",
      "green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and\r\n",
      "paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand\r\n",
      "with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand\r\n",
      "to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would\r\n",

      "grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance\r\n",
      "at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were\r\n",
      "alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to\r\n",
      "seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round\r\n",
      "her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she\r\n",
      "turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\r\n",
      "moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,\r\n",

      "differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\r\n",
      "him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound\r\n",

      "_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence\r\n",
      "and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an\r\n",
      "external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not\r\n",
      "think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\r\n",
      "analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\r\n",
      "into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself\r\n",

      "books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject\r\n",
